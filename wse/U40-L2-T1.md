So have you looked through the contract yet?
I had my Chinese lawyer draw it up, then I got it translated into English.
我让我的中国律师起草了这份文件，之后把它翻译成了英文。
So it all made sense then, more or less?
所以当时这一切就或多或少说得通了，对吧？

It was pretty much what I was expecting.
You're not giving much away, for the investment you're asking for. Just a 20% share of the stock, for two million.

This store is going to be a goldmine.
这家店准能赚大钱。

It doesn't look like I'll be getting much of the gold.
I'll have them send in the first-candidate.

When I'm interviewing people,

Why do you want to change field?

What about traning and motivation?

We need to interview one or two more people.

She was useless.
I could see that as soon as she walked in.
Like she said, you didn't give her much of chance.
I thought that guy had some potential.
我以为那家伙有潜力。
In a fast foot restaurant, maybe. Not in a fashion store.


I won't have anyone ask you anymore questions.
When can you have someone pick these up?
I'll have my boss discuss this with you as soon as possible.
Why can't we have anyone else get the papers?
I'll get him to say yes.
We'll have him sign it before we give it to him.
The company will have it translated for us.

You have offered to entertain Robert Pitz, a foreign employee of your company, tomorrow evening, and show him around your city. He calls you at works; you answer the telephone, and agree that you will be able to meet him. Arrange a time and place to meet. As he is a stranger to your city, you will also need to describe how to get there by public tansport. Finally, describe yourself and/or say what you will be wearing, so that he will recognize you.

You arrive late at the place you agreed to meet Robert. You apologize to him, giving an explanation for your lateness. Then you ask Robert if he is enjoying himself in your city, where he is staying, and if his hotel is alright.

At the end of the evening Robert thanks you for a pleasant time, to which you reply politely, and he invites you to visit him in his own country some time. You thank him and tell him politely but not too definitely that you would like to accept his invitation. Then you leave him.

I think we should go through an agency in order to find some good salespeople.
I really want to apply for this job.
We have already interviewed three candidates for the position. Now we just have to decide which one to hire.
I really hope we land that contract.
我真的希望我们能签下这份合同。
In order to be successful, a company needs to make profit.
There is a lot of potential for that company to grow.
I need to create my resume if I want to apply for a job.
Tourism is an industry which includes hotels, vacation places, and tourists.
Frank is the floor manager. That means he's in charge of the prodcut organization.
After two years of losing money, the company has finally managed to make a profit.

为了掌握当今的营销技巧，我们所有的经理都会参加研讨会和培训。
Our company specializes in services to the middle-aged crowd.

| I don't think we should hire her.                            | You're right. She's useless because she doesn't know anything about our industry. |
