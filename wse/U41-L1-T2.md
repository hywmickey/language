否定式：You don’t be late!（你别迟到！）/ You not be absent!（你别缺席！）

The one over there with the broken window.

My motorcycle is out of gas again.
I need to get my car to that gas station, so can you help me push my car there?
I've run out of energy because I was swimming all day, so I really need to rest now.

Considering that I have more money than you do, why don't you let me pay?
代动词 do 的作用：此处 do 是代动词，代替前面的实义动词 have，避免重复（完整形式是 than you have），符合英语 “简洁表达” 原则；
How dare you say such a thing to your mother! You should apologize!
My car window is broken, so do you know where I can have it repaired?
Why don't you have Silvia do something with your hair; she really knows how to cut hair nicely.

My car is not really orange; it is just rusty.

什么是代动词
代动词是英语中**用来替代前文已经出现过的实义动词（或动词短语）的词**，核心作用是**避免重复**，让句子更简洁流畅。英语中最常用的代动词是 **do/does/did**，此外 **be动词（am/is/are/was/were）**、**have/has/had** 等也可根据前文动词的类型充当代动词，且时态、人称需与前文动词保持一致。

一、核心代动词分类及用法（附例句）
1. 最常用代动词：do/does/did（替代**实义动词原形/过去式/现在分词**，适用于除be动词、完成时have外的多数动词）
这是日常交流中最频繁的代动词用法，尤其在比较句、省略句、回应句中常见。
- **肯定句中**：替代前文的实义动词，保持时态一致
  例1：He works harder than you **do**.（他比你工作努力。→ do替代works）
  例2：I ate an apple, and she **did** too.（我吃了个苹果，她也吃了。→ did替代ate）
  例3：你之前纠错句中的用法：I have more money than you **do**.（我比你有钱。→ do替代have，避免重复说“than you have”）
- **否定句中**：用 don’t/doesn’t/didn’t 替代“实义动词+not”
  例：She doesn’t like coffee, but I **do**.（她不喜欢咖啡，但我喜欢。→ do替代like coffee）

2. be动词作代动词（替代前文的**be动词短语**，适用于主系表结构）
前文出现am/is/are/was/were时，用对应的be动词形式替代，避免重复系表结构。
- 例1：Tom is a student, and his sister **is** too.（汤姆是学生，他妹妹也是。→ is替代is a student）
- 例2：They were late yesterday, and we **were** too.（他们昨天迟到了，我们也迟到了。→ were替代were late）
- 例3：A: Are you tired? B: Yes, I **am**.（A：你累吗？B：是的，我累。→ am替代am tired）

3. have/has/had作代动词（替代前文的**完成时结构**或**实义动词have**）
分两种情况，一是替代“have/has/had+过去分词”的完成时，二是替代“拥有”含义的实义动词have。
- 替代完成时：
  例：She has finished her homework, and I **have** too.（她做完作业了，我也做完了。→ have替代have finished her homework）
- 替代实义动词have（表“拥有”，多用于英式英语）：
  例：A: Do you have a pen? B: Yes, I **do**.（美式常用，do替代have a pen）/ Yes, I **have**.（英式常用，have替代have a pen）

二、代动词的高频使用场景
1. **比较状语从句**（than/as引导的句子）：这是你之前句子中用到的场景，核心是简化比较对象后的动词重复。
   例：She runs faster than he **does**.（她比他跑得快。→ does替代runs）
2.  **简短回应/附和句**（表示“也/不”）：日常对话中快速回应，避免啰嗦。
    例：A: I love music. B: Me **too**.（A：我喜欢音乐。B：我也是。→ 口语中省略do，完整是I do too）
3.  **反义疑问句**：结尾的附加疑问用代动词替代主句的实义动词。
    例：You went to the park yesterday, **didn’t you**?（你昨天去公园了，对吧？→ didn’t you替代didn’t go to the park）
4.  **避免动词重复的并列句**：前后分句动词一致时，后句用代动词。
    例：He will call you, and I **will** too.（他会给你打电话，我也会。→ will替代will call you）

三、使用注意事项（避免踩坑）
1.  **时态/人称必须一致**：代动词的形式要和前文被替代的动词保持时态、单复数一致。
    ✅ 正确：She sings well, and her brother **does** too.（does对应sings的第三人称单数）
    ❌ 错误：She sings well, and her brother do too.
2.  **不能替代非谓语动词**：代动词只能替代句子中的谓语动词，不能替代不定式、动名词等非谓语形式。
    例：I want to go shopping, and she wants to **too**.（此处不能用does替代to go shopping，需保留to）
3.  **实义动词have的特殊处理**：美式英语中常用do/does/did替代表“拥有”的have，英式英语可直接用have/has/had替代。

This is a self-service station, so you have to get the gas yourself. 为什么不用 by yourself?

这句话中用 **yourself** 和 **by yourself** 语法上都正确，但核心差异在于 **语义侧重不同**，原句用 **yourself** 更贴合自助加油站的场景需求，精准强调“动作需亲自执行”，而 **by yourself** 会偏离场景核心语义。下面结合用法本质、场景适配和对比示例，详细拆解：
一、核心差异：反身代词 vs 介词短语的功能不同
1. 原句用 **yourself**：强调“动作亲自做，而非他人代劳”
- **词性与作用**：**反身代词**（作宾语补足语），紧贴动词 `get`，用于强调 **动作的执行者是主语本人**，排除“别人帮忙加油”的可能性，核心语义是“亲手完成动作”。
- **场景适配**：自助加油站的核心规则是“自己动手加油，没有工作人员代劳”，这里的 `yourself` 正是突出这一核心要求——加油这个动作必须你自己做，不是别人帮你做。
- **例句拓展**：
  - You have to sign the document **yourself**.（你必须亲自签这份文件。→ 强调亲手签，不能代签）
  - She made the cake **herself**.（这蛋糕是她亲手做的。→ 突出亲手制作）

2. 若用 **by yourself**：强调“独自一人做，无他人陪伴/协助”
- **词性与作用**：**介词短语**（作方式状语），核心语义是 **“独自、单独”**，侧重描述“做某事时的状态是孤身一人”，而非强调“动作是否亲自执行”。
- **场景偏离**：自助加油站不限制“是否独自加油”——你完全可以和朋友一起去，朋友在旁边等，你自己动手加油（符合自助规则）。但如果用 `by yourself`，句子含义会变成“你得独自一人去加油”，这和加油站“自助”的核心提示无关，属于语义跑偏。
- **例句拓展**：
  - I finished the project **by myself**.（我独自一人完成了这个项目。→ 强调没人帮忙、孤身完成）
  - Don’t go out **by yourself** at night.（晚上别独自出门。→ 强调孤身一人的状态）

二、关键用法对比表（一目了然）
| 用法                | 核心语义                | 侧重点                  | 适配场景                  | 原句替换后的效果                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **get the gas yourself** | 自己动手加油            | 动作亲自执行，排除代劳  | 自助服务提示（核心需求）  | 符合场景，精准传达“自助”规则              |
| **get the gas by yourself** | 独自一人加油            | 做动作时孤身一人，无陪伴 | 强调“独处状态”的场景      | 语义偏离，暗示“不能和他人同行”，不符合实际 |

三、特殊情况：何时可用 by yourself？
只有当你想强调“加油时没有其他人协助/陪伴”时，才适合用 `by yourself`，但这和“自助加油站”的常规提示无关。  
例：If your friend is busy, you’ll have to get the gas **by yourself**.（如果你的朋友没空，你就得自己一个人去加油了。→ 此处强调“没人陪伴帮忙”，符合 `by yourself` 的语义）

四、补充：反身代词（oneself）与 by oneself 的通用区别
1. **反身代词（myself/yourself/herself）**：常与动词搭配，强调 **“亲自、亲手”**，是动作的核心补充，突出“谁来做”；
2.  **by oneself**：表 **“独自、独立”**，是对动作状态的描述，突出“做的时候有没有别人”。

简单记：**“亲自做”用 oneself，“独自做”用 by oneself**。原句自助加油站的核心是“亲自动手”，所以用 `yourself` 是最地道的选择。
