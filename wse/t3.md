I’m sort of busy right now.（我这会儿算是有点忙。）

纠错：You looked as if you were sort of needed my help, and I wanted to be nice.



正确句子应为：**You looked as if you were sort of needing my help, and I wanted to be nice.**  

错误原因解析（用简单的话讲清楚）：
原句里的“were sort of needed”错在“需要”的语态用反了——  
“needed”在这里是“被需要”的意思（比如“help is needed”是“需要帮助”），但句子想表达的是“你（主动）需要我的帮助”，不是“你被需要帮助”，所以要把被动的“needed”改成主动的“needing”，和前面的“were”搭配，符合“looked as if（看起来好像）”后面描述“当时正在发生的状态”的感觉。  

而“sort of”（有点儿、大概）的用法是对的，放在“were”和“needing”之间，刚好修饰“需要”的程度，让语气更自然，符合日常说话的随意感。  


补充：更简洁的口语表达
日常聊天时，还可以把“were sort of needing”简化成“sort of needed”（去掉“were”），句子会更流畅，意思不变：  
**You looked as if you sort of needed my help, and I wanted to be nice.**  
（原因：“looked as if”后面接“一般过去时”也能表达“过去的状态”，口语里这样说更省事，比如“他看起来好像累了”可以说“He looked as if he was tired”或“He looked as if he tired”，后者更口语化）  


例句语境（帮你理解怎么用）：
比如你帮了别人，对方问你“为什么突然帮我呀？”，你就可以说：  
- A: Thanks for helping me carry the bags—why did you stop to help?  
  （A：谢谢你帮我拎包，你怎么会停下来帮忙呀？）  
- B: Oh, no big deal. You looked as if you were sort of needing my help, and I wanted to be nice.  
  （B：哦，没什么。我看你好像有点儿需要帮忙，就想着顺手帮个忙呗。）
