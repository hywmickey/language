I just looked in his bag.

They didn't tell me why you are here.
Did you hear that?
Come on, quickly. There's no time! Let's go!
Why are you driving so slowly?
Take it easy, will you?
You can't drive quickly on this road. It's dangerous.
It's a long way.
Will you please tell me what's going on?

Look out!

So, a policeman stoped you at the airport. 
Yes sir, but he didn't find anything!
Then what did you do, Peters?
I didn't do anything, really.
And a policeman listened to your telephone.
