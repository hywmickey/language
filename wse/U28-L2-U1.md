I don't call this "family entertainment"!
I'm not listening to this stuff!
You told me they were going to play Tony Moroni songs!
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell them.

Get them off the stage!

Hey, we'd better get out here.

I'm sincerely sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.
It was a most unfortunate mistake, we're just moving the equipment off the stage now.
We'll continue our social evening, with the happy country songs of Kari and the Rovers.

You were going to give us a hundred dollars.
你本来打算给我们一百美元的。
Would you believe it?
They've driven off without me!
他们没等我，自己开车走了。

They've thrown me out of my apartment!
Now I haven't even got anyplace to live!

I want to speak with the Boss.
And what makes you think the Boss wants to speak with you?
There's a most unpleasant guy on the phone, called Roger Petri.
Roger Petri? How can that be?
You thought you had gotten ride of me when I went to prison.
If I spoke to the police, they'd come around to your "farm" in ten seconds.
You wouldn't want that, would you?
I'm ready to make a deal with you.
If you pay me two million dollars, I'll go away, and I'll never bother you again. Is it a deal?
There's a place called Dead Man's hell. 
It's on the road that goes along the south coast of the island.
My men will be in a white Cadillac with the number PEC 999.
Petri's even more of a fool than Hugo Peters.
He's trying to blackmail me.


You wouldn't like it if I called the police.
If you gave me the money, I'd leave you alone.
Clive wouldn't let the band play at the club if John had another group.
John wouldn't need to borrow bus money if Sasa were still there.
He'd drive you to the airport if you asked him.
If he had enough money, John would buy a new car.

They said neigher of them had a driver's license!
John said they would play Tony Moroni songs.
Clive told the audience he was sorry.
He thought the music would be pleasant.
Roger thought Mr. P would give him two million dollars.

They make the most delicious desserts.
We're staying at the most wonderful hotel.
It's the most beautiful beach.

We're late. We had better leave.
I thought you were going to buy us a new car.
Would you belive it? My car is gone.
Would you take me to the airport? I need to catch a flight.
I can't wait to see that new movie! It's supposed to be great!
He wouldn't want that for his birthday, would he?
We will be there tomorrow.
I'd better drive them back to Syracuse now.
That's funny. The car won't start.
真有趣。这辆车竟然发动不了。
I was fired! Now haven't even got a job!
You were fired? How can that be?
你被解雇了？怎么会这样？
She will have to find him, of course.

Go away and don't bother me again.
