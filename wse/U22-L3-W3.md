Where is Gabe? at a university.

When did the woman start studying Spanish? in high school.
How long do the students at the university have to learn a new language? four.
Why does one man think that Americans have a hard time learning language? Americans are not near many other language.
Why does one woman think that Chinese is going to be such an important language? because most of the people in the would are Chinese.


We're on the campus of Georgetown University, talking about studying foreign languages.
So when I got to seventh grade, I had to choose a foreign language to study in school.
So when I got here, I decided to become a double major_.

I would consider myself professioned__

I chose Japanese mainly because I'm interested in Japanese culture and language.
I'm Chinese myself, my parents are from Hong Kong, so I was brought up listening to Cantonese.
I decide to learn Mandarin.
I started studying Spanish in high school because my father's s Puerto Rican, and I considered it part of my heritage.
I picked Russian because I wanted to learn a more challenging language.
The idea of being able to go to a place and speak to the people in their native language, is really cool.

Given the various techniques there are to learn a language, which do you prefer: classroom or online?
The good thing is to have multiple sources of information.
The most important thing is that the students should be familiar with the avalible resources.
Is it difficult to teach a foreign languge to American students?
Not at all, they're highly motivated(积极主动) and hard-working.
Are you saying that four years is not enough time to lean a language?
It depends on the student's goal: if they want to be fluent in Japanese, to be at an advanced level.

We're an isolated country, with very few foreign languages spoken adjacent to us.
I think a big part of it is that you need to stay motivated.

In Europe it's a lot easier to go across borders and hear a foreign language spoken.
As you can see(如你所见) and as you know(如你所知), it takes a lot of dedication to master a foreign language.
So Stick with it. It is well worth it.


Georgetown University has a very large campus in Washington,DC.

Even though my parents speak Italian, I wasn't brought up speaking Italian. That's why I'm studying it now.
His father is Puerto Rican, so he considers Spanish part of his heritage.
She wants to study a more challenging language, like Japanese.
Englishi is considered to be the common language in business.
He studies languages because he likes meeting people from other places and cultures.
She's familiar with the Cyrillic(西里尔的) alphabet, but she doesn't speak Russian.
To learn a new language, you must be hard-working and have a lot of dedication.

It's better to have multiple sources of information.
She's living in Chicago, but she's taking a class online from the University of Berlin.
There are various techniques to learn a language besides going to a classroom.
Are any of the university computers avalible? I need to check something online.
Book and CDs are some of the resources you can use to learn a new language.
She's proficient in Russian grammar, but her pronumciation is terrible!

Mastering Asian Languages
The number one reason students of Asian languages quit before they become fluent is frustration. For the dedicated student of Chinese of Japanese, my obstacles must be overcome before they can become even a little fluent.
Chinese and Japanese Are Harder: For English speakers, Chinese and Japanese are much harder to master than European languages. The English language and culture share common roots with the European languages and cultrues. Chinese and Japanese, however, have very different sentence structures and are based on very different cultual assumptions. For example, a simple idea in English or Japanese could require a paragraph in the other language.
Learning Thousands of Characters Comes before Listening and Speaking: The ablility to recognize, interpret and pronounce thousands of Chinese characters-each individually challenging to learn and remember - is essential for proficiency. Asians spend years learning their own language， Traditional Asian education focuses on learning of lots of facts by memory. Chinese character writing and reading are taught based on a system that introduces specific characters in each new school year.
However, learning many facts of characters is no longer done in U.S. education. Most Americans have not practiced memorization since learning math. This situation leaves the Asian language students upprepared for studying Asian languages. They are not used to interested in spending long hours memorizing Chinese characters. So many students quit their study of Asian languages because they Can't master their wirtten forms.
Asian Language Learning is Slower: After one year of study, an English -speaking student of German, Spanish of French would be able to speak a little in the language and read and write letters with a dictionary. But even with hard work, a students of Chinese of Japanse man not be able to do this. An Asian language student may not be able to recognize enough charactoers and may not yet be able to use a dictionary.
Difficulties of Chinese: First, Chinese uses several sounds not found in English that English speakers must learn. Also, Chinese use tones(the pitch at which a syllable is spoken) much more than other languages do. Mandarin uses five tones, and Cantonese use nine different tones! Also, there are two sets of Chinese characters: traditional and simplified. Taiwan and Hong Kong use the Traditional Chinese character set, while mainland China uses a newer, simplified set.
Difficulties of Japanese: Because the Japanese adapted Chinese writing to a completely different spoken language, Japanese writing is even more difficult to master than Chinese writing. And the student who is hoping for fluency must also learn other grammatical rules of the Japanese languge. For example, Japanese uses a reverse word order to make complicated sentences. Long phrases are used to change words that may be a part of other phrases. Also as a spoken language, Japanese uses fewer sounds than English, which make repetitive and confusing sound combinations. For example, imagine hearing the defferent between "atatatakatada" from "attakatada". Finally, Japanese is highly inflected(words change form) based on the status of the speaker, listener and the subject of the conversation, as well as "politeness level"
Asian Find it Hard, Too: Additionally, calligraphy is a primary part of Japanese and Chinese education. At an early age, Chinese and Japanese children learn to draw characters that fit into a box on a fixed grid page. Well-drawn and "beautiful" characters are appreciated by almost every native speaker.
Educational Problems: Japanese and Chinese texts teach the language in an old fashioned style, like "the pen of my aunt is on the table of my uncle." This same technique makes it difficult for Asian students of English because their traditional language instruction concentrates on the written a language and grammar rules. The result: most native Japanese can not speak much English at all, even after five of more years of intense English study.

What is the main reason that students of Asian language stop studying before they can speak the language? frustration.
What is the learning focus of traditional Asian education? memory.
Why does it take longer to learn an Asian language than a European language? Students have to learn a lot of characters.
What is one reason why Chinese is so hard for English speakers to learn? It has sounds that English does not have.
What makes Japanese sentences so difficult? The word order is reversed.
What is one reason why spoken Japanese is hard for English speakers? A lot of the sounds are repeated.
When do Chinese and Japanese native speakers begin learning to write? when they are children.
Why can't most native Japanese speak much English even after studying it for years? They spend more time leaning the rules of the language than speaking.

If the train is on schedule it will arrive at 10:27.

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Could you repeat that?
She has studided English for many years, and now speaks at an advanced level.
French is not a foreign language in Canada, but German is.
He doesn't have any friends; he's very alone and isolated.

The Russian couple have gone; they left last week.
