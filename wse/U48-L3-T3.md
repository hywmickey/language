He just had some people pretend to kidnap him, and then we paid the ransome money into a Swiss bank account.
他只是找了些人假装绑架自己，然后我们就把赎金打到了一个瑞士银行账户里。
have sb do sth：使役结构（表示 “让 / 叫某人做某事”，强调 “主语主动安排或指使他人完成某个动作”），区别于 “have sb doing sth”（表 “让某人持续做某事”，如 “He had the kids waiting outside”= 他让孩子们一直在外面等）。

How can you have the nerve to come around here?
你怎么敢有脸到这儿来？
have the nerve to do sth.：高频负面短语，“竟敢、有脸做某事（通常是让人反感、不道德或越界的事）”，比如 “have the nerve to lie to me”（有脸对我说谎）、“have the nerve to ask for a raise after missing deadlines”（拖了工期还敢提加薪）；
come around here：“around” 无实际意义，仅表 “出现在、到（此地）”，无需直译 “周围”，避免冗余。

休想写任何关于这件事的只言片语！（或 “不准你写任何关于这件事的内容，敢都别敢！”）
I won't be treated like this!
我绝不会容忍被这样对待！（或 “我可不会任人这么对待我！”）
否定词 “won't”：表 “坚决不会、绝不容忍”，不是 “可能不接受”，而是 “完全拒绝、零容忍”，语气比 “don't want to”（不想）强硬得多 —— 比如 “我不想被这样对待” 是委婉表达，“我绝不会被这样对待” 是明确反抗；





Where's Hugo Peters?
You're after him too, are you? He's a popular guy.
你也在找他，对吧？他可真 “抢手” 啊。
Whoever it is this time, I am definitely not letting them in!
不管这次是谁，我绝对不会让他们进来！

我去放点音乐，这儿的音乐收藏还挺不错的。

I'll go out and get some booze, if someone will lend me a few bucks.
booze:酒精饮料
You might as well enjoy the party.
你不如好好享受这个派对。
might as well：“不如、倒不如、不妨”，表示 “在当前情境下，做某事是‘合理且划算’的选择 —— 既没有更好的替代方案，也没必要浪费现有机会”，语气温和，无命令感，更像 “基于现实的建议”。
    无法改变现状，建议 “顺势而为”：Since the bus is late, we might as well walk.（既然公交车晚点了，我们不如走路。）
    没有更好选择，建议 “退而求其次 / 合理利用”：There’s nothing good on TV—we might as well read a book.（电视上没什么好看的，我们不如看本书。）



I can't face my sister right now. I borrowed her car and crashed it, and now her car is ruined.
Please keep her far away from me because I just really don't like her. I just can't stand her.
How can my house be burning? This just can't be happening!
I don't believe he's dead. It just can't be true. I just saw him yesterday.
Don't even go to the interview. That job is just out of your reach.

I knew in my heart that he and I were meant to be together.

There is going to be a police raid of the school tomorrow because they think there are a lot of drugs.
He belongs to a very dangerous gang of criminals.
The police told us to stay where we are or they will shoot.

我很佩服你这么好心。
Don't you dare speak to me again.
你再敢跟我说话试试！
    Don't you dare touch my things without asking!（你敢不问就碰我的东西试试！）
    She yelled, “Don't you dare lie to me again!”（她大喊：“你再敢骗我试试！”）
I tried to persuade him not to go there by himself.
I know it will never happen, but I really wish you'd stop doing that.
I really just want to watch TV. I am just not in the mood for studying.

Can someone put on some music so that it's not so quite here?
Look at this collection of CDs. It's amazing. He's got everything from RB to classical.
He's got loads of stuff to drink. There is more than enough for everyone.
Do you want some booze? I have got wine, beer, or brandy.
Welcome and enjoy the party.
With a few more bucks. I could buy more food for us.


John Berry Associates 
Apartment 167 2287 Lower Mean Street 
Queens, New York
A message to all students at Wall Street Institute: 
Dear Friends,
It is with a great deal of sadness that I pick up my pen to write these words, or, to be more accurate, I pick up my computer. Well I don't actually pick it up, because there's no need to: I put it down, really, rather than picking it up.
Anyway, as I was saying, it is with a considerable amount of regret that I put down my laptop to write these words, or to type them, rather.
My friends (for I feel that we have become friends, following all those hours we've spent alone together in the Speaking Center), you and I have kept each other company throughout this long journey, which is now about to end.
You have been the travelers, and I have been your guide. Through me, you have learned to speak English, the world's most widely-spoken language, and you have also learned a wide range of business and professional skills, such as successful salesmanship, and how to behave in a job interview.
I have also entertained you with my wonderful collection of Tony Moroni records, and, I hope, helped to make the world a less confusing and upsetting place for you by passing on something of my own philosophy of life.
The question you will no doubt be asking yourselves at this point is: "How will we manage in the future without John's support and advice?" The thought that when you have completed your study of this course you will be on your own must be terrifying you.
Well, my friends, I've got great news for you, you needn't be on your own. John Berry Associates is able to offer the following services at special bargain rates to Wall Street Institute students.
Language consultancy: Private lessons in English, in your own home, or, for young ladies only, at your local dance club or hamburger restaurant.
Business consultancy: All your business and marketing problems solved in a matter of minutes, simply by the application of the John Berry rapid success approach.
As you can imagine, the demand for these services is going to be enormous, so, in order to avoid disappointment, write(enclosing a generous check) as soon as possible.

I really need a new computer, but I prefer one I can carry with me everywhere, like a laptop.
I have a job interview tomorrow for that position I saw advertised in the paper. I hope I get the job.
Thank you for all your support, both financial and personal, throughout this difficult part of my life.
I wonder what kind of salary that new position will be paying.
My boss just gave me a promotion but no raise. He said that if I take the higher position.
我老板刚给我升了职，却没给我加薪。他说要是我接受这个更高的职位
	She worked hard for a year and finally got a promotion.（她努力工作了一年，终于获得了升职。）
	I asked my boss for a raise last week, but he said the company is tight on budget.（我上周跟老板申请加薪，可他说公司预算紧张。）
	They offered her a higher position in Beijing, but she decided not to take it because of her family.（他们给她提供了北京的一个更高职位，但她因为家人决定不接受。）
Please accept my resume which I have enclosed with my letter.
敬请查收我随信附上的简历。
	I enclosed a photo with my letter.（我随信附上一张照片。）
	I attached my resume to the email.（我将简历作为附件添加到邮件中。）
I regret to inform you that you are fired.
我很遗憾地通知你，你被解雇了。
He just started his own consultancy firm.
他刚刚创办了自己的咨询公司。
	
Dear Mr. Berry,
I am writing to you in reference to your informative letter explaining your services.
I was particularly interested in your business consultancy services.
I own a language school here in New York, but my school does not have enough students.
Therefore, I am looking for a good marketing person to help us find more customers for the many services that we offer.
Right now, we offer our students a wide range of services, including translation services, language study, and test preparation.
But we need a bit of help getting our message out to the public.
We have been entertainning the idea of hiring someone for a long time, but it was not until I received your letter that I was finally ready to respond.
We would appreciate meeting you to see what support you would be able to provide us.
Of course, we are willing to write quite a large check of for your services.
Since we are ready in demand of your services, I would actually like to meet with you as soon as possible.
Our list of things to do is enormous and to get through it, we really need your help.
We look forward to meeting with you and having you pass on your skills and knowledge to us.
Sincerly, John Jacobs.

（1）**out of touch**

- 核心含义：**与某人失去联系；疏于联络**（特指 “原本有往来，后来因各种原因断了沟通”），也可引申为 “不了解某领域 / 某人的近况”（如 “He’s out of touch with modern technology”= 他不了解现代科技）。
- 常用搭配：**be out of touch with sb**（与某人断联）；**get out of touch**（逐渐断联）；**stay in touch**（保持联系，其反义短语）。
- 对话场景例句：
  - I’ve been so busy with work that I got out of touch with my best friend.（我最近工作太忙，跟最好的朋友断了联系。）
  - Let’s exchange WeChat so we don’t get out of touch again.（咱们加个微信吧，别再断联了。）

（2）**make it up**

- 核心含义：**弥补（过错 / 断联的关系）；挽回**（此处结合 “断联” 语境，指 “通过后续行动修复关系”）；也可表示 “补偿（损失 / 亏欠）”（如 “make it up to sb”= 补偿某人）。
- 关键区分：“make it up” 后接 “to sb” 时，明确指向 “补偿某人”（如 “I’ll make it up to you by treating you to dinner”= 我请你吃饭补偿你）；单独用 “make it up” 时，需结合语境判断（本句中省略 “to you”，但默认指向 “弥补与对方的关系”）。
- 对话场景例句：
  - I forgot her birthday, but I’ll make it up with a surprise gift.（我忘了她的生日，但会用一份惊喜礼物弥补。）
  - He apologized and promised to make it up to me for the mistake.（他道歉了，并承诺会为这个错误补偿我。）
