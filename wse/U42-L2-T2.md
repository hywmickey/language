我身上有一把刀，所以我知道如果他攻击我，我可以自卫。
in case： 如果，万一；也许，说不定；以备，以防，免得，以防万一；
You're wasting your time. There's no fuel.
I had to stay in that boat, it was my only chance.

Then I fell asleep on the beach, where I lay until I was found by a couple of tourists.
然后我在海滩上睡着了，就那样躺在那里，直到被一对游客发现。

I might have become dangerously weak from hunger, but fortunately I found a bar of chocolate.
我或许已因饥饿变得虚弱到危险的地步，但幸运的是，我找到了一块巧克力。
might have become：情态动词 might + 完成时 have done，用于对过去情况的不确定推测，译为 “或许已经……”“可能已经……”
dangerously weak：副词 dangerously 修饰形容词 weak，强调 “虚弱的程度达到危险级别”，而非 “危险地虚弱”，中文转化为 “虚弱到危险的地步”“极度虚弱” 更符合表达习惯；
from hunger：介词短语表原因，译为 “因饥饿”，英文中常用 from 引出 “由某种因素导致的状态”，类似搭配如 tired from work（因工作疲惫）；
By the next morning I had finished it, and I was terribly hungry as well.
第二天早上，我吃完了，我也饿得要命。

It was brown and rusty, but it saved my life.
它是棕色的，生锈了，但它救了我的命。

I remember dreaming at one point that I was a child again.
我记得某个时刻梦见自己又变回了小孩子。
at one point：常用时间短语，译为 “某个时刻”“曾经有那么一刻”，侧重过去某个特定的、短暂的时间节点，比 once 更强调 “具体某一瞬间”，类似搭配如 at one point during the meeting（会议中的某个时刻）；

You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
老狗不能学新东西。/ 你不能教老狗新把戏。

get away with doing sth.：高频口语短语，核心含义是 “做某事而不被发现、不被惩罚或不产生不良后果”，此处结合语境译为 “做某事不会有事”，而非直译 “侥幸逃脱”。
How exactly do you go about losing a car?
你到底是怎么把车弄丢的？
go about doing sth.：怎么会...
拓展例句：How do you go about applying for a visa?（你是如何申请签证的？）（表 “着手做”）；How did you go about breaking the vase?（你怎么把花瓶打碎的？）（表 “以某种方式导致意外”）

这与此无关。你预订餐桌了吗？
Look what you've made me do!
看看你让我做了什么！
Look, my dress is ruined!
你看，我的裙子弄脏了 / 弄坏了！
is ruined：核心语义是「被毁坏、无法恢复原状」，译为「全毁了」比「坏了」「毁了」更能强化情绪 ——「全」字突出损坏程度深（如大面积污渍、撕裂、变形等），贴合说话人懊恼的心态。
✅ 补充：「ruined」此处为被动语态（be + 过去分词），强调「裙子被外部因素破坏」（而非自身损坏），中文用「全毁了」自然隐含被动含义，无需直译「被毁掉了」（冗余且不口语）。

天气实在太热了，但喝了不少水后，我凉快了下来。
cooled me off：英语常用口语短语，= cooled me down，意为 “使我凉快下来、给我降温”，off 在此处强化 “从燥热状态中缓解过来” 的动作效果
drinking a lot：动名词短语作主语，结合前文 “天气炎热” 的语境，a lot 明确指代 “a lot of water”（大量的水），中文翻译需补全隐含宾语，译为 “喝了不少水”，避免直译 “喝很多” 导致语义模糊；

我想创业，可压根不知道该怎么起步。
setting one up：one 指代前文的 business，避免重复，set up 侧重 “从零开始筹备、搭建（机构 / 企业）”，与 start a business 语义呼应但侧重不同 ——start 强调 “启动” 的动作，set up 强调 “筹备、搭建框架” 的过程，译为 “筹备”“搭建” 贴合语境。
Paolo was arrested for causing an accident on the road.
I don't konw how they managed to enter the apartment. I remember locking the door.
我不知道他们是怎么设法闯进公寓的。我记得当时锁了门。
managed to enter：manage to do sth. 固定搭配，强调 “设法做成了某事”（暗含过程有难度，但最终成功），区别于 tried to enter（试图进入，不明确是否成功），译为 “设法闯进”“成功进入”，结合 “闯入他人公寓” 的语境，用 “闯进” 更贴合潜在的意外感；
remember locking the door：复用 remember + doing sth. 结构，表 “记得曾经做过某事”，此处 locking 强调 “锁门” 这个动作在过去已经完成，译为 “记得当时锁了门”，通过 “当时” 体现动作发生在过去，呼应前文 “他们闯入” 的过去场景。

I have a box in which I keep all my personal things.
不可直接说 “I have a box which I keep all my personal things.”—— 缺少介词 in 会导致从句语法残缺（keep 是及物动词，但此处需表达 “在盒子里存放”，必须有地点介词支撑）。
介词+which/whom 替代关系副词（where/when/why），其中：
    指物用 which（本句先行词 box 是物，故用 which）；
    指人用 whom（如：He is the man with whom I worked. 他是和我共事过的人）；
    介词选择依据：① 先行词的固定搭配（本句 box 与 in 搭配，in the box 表示 “在盒子里”）；② 从句中动词的固定搭配（如：This is the book about which we talked. 这是我们讨论过的书，talk about 是固定搭配）。
That's a gym where I met my boyfriend. He's an instructor there.
Do you know the city where Adam lives?

You can find the ice cream in the freezer.
You can find the milk in the refrigerator.
You will have to get it yourself because this is a self-service store.
The mustard is on that shelf there.
Cigarettes are located behind the counter.
香烟放在柜台后面。
We put wine and beer on the top shelf, to keep them away from children.

NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT - Arrest Report Sheet FOR THE ATTENTION OF:
Chief Inspector Henson, Insepctor Bedges
NAME OF SUSPECT: Mr. John A. Berry
REASONS FOR ARREST:
1-Use of bad language in a pulibc place.
2-Wasting a police officer's time.
3-Damaging property and causing danger to the public.
4-There was something I didn't like about him.
DETAILED REPORT OF THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE ARREST:
The suspect came into Mean Street Police Station at 4:37 p.m. on Wednesday, February 15th, claiming to have lost his car. Of course, this story did not satisfy an experienced police officer like myself, and I immediately started to question him.
After about three-quarters of an hour he changed his story, claiming that the vehicle had been stolen. Something about his story, too, sounded extremely unlikely, and I refused to accept it.
The suspect insisted on his story, however, and it was only by using the "active questioning techniques", which I learned on the every enjoyable traning course recently given by Chief Inspector Henson, that I was able to get the real truth of him.
When he finally broke down under my questions he admitted that he had parked his car in a no-parking zone, and then blowit it up. I haven't yet figured out what reasons he may have had for doing this.
My theory is that he is a mentally ill anarchist terrorist who sees parking regulations as a symbol of everything he hates most in modern society.
Signed, Inspector Philip E. Morris
P.S. I haven't written his statement yet, please advise me on what it should say, and I shall get him to sign it as soon as possible.

You cannot walk around without clothes in a public place or the police will arrest you.
This is such nonsense, so please don't waste my time on it.
This house is my property, and you cannot just move in.
People with guns just want to cause trouble.
He has a criminal record; he has been arrested for stealing, killing, and damaging buildings.
Under the police officer's questioning, I just broke down and cried.
The terroist had a bomb.
The experienced police officer could tell if the man was lying or telling the truth.
Unitl they can prove that he really did it, he is a suspect.
He is such a trouble-maker. Wherever he goes, he makes problems.

I has lost my cell phone, but fortunately I had a credit card to make a call.
He talked hurriedly as if he did not have enough time to spend with us.
I love how nothing ever makes her upset. She takes things so calmly.
我真喜欢她这一点 —— 从来没有什么事能让她不高兴，她处理事情总是那么冷静。
I love how...：译为「我真喜欢她这一点 ——」，用「真喜欢」强化赞美语气；我喜欢…… 的特质 / 样子
He has been extremely generous to us; he basically give us whatever we ask for.
Please don't take him seriously. He is always joking.
You had better start studying becuase you are coming dangerously close to failing the class.
He is incredibly good-looking; I just can't get my eyes off him.
He drives way too fast. I wish he drove more slowly.
way too + 形容词 / 副词：固定结构，表「实在太……、过于……」，比 "too..." 语气更强（way 此处为副词，加强程度，口语高频）。
The police must surely have some idea of who committed the crime.
警方想必一定对谁是作案者有所头绪。（或更口语化：警方肯定知道谁犯了罪 / 干了这事。）
must surely：双重肯定表「强烈推测」，译为「想必一定」「肯定」
some idea（一些线索 / 头绪）
He is usually on time; I don't konw what happened today.
He can't stop what he is doing because he doesn't think like you and me; he is mentally ill.
mentally ill：患有精神疾病

“介词+关系代词”（介词+which/whom/whose）是定语从句中高频易错结构，核心易混点集中在 **介词选择、关系代词匹配、与关系副词的替换、介词位置、固定搭配拆分** 五大维度。以下结合具体场景和易错案例，用“易错点+原因分析+正确示范+避坑技巧”的逻辑拆解，兼顾实用性和精准性：

一、核心易混点深度解析（附场景化案例）
易混点1：介词选择——到底看“先行词”还是“从句动词”？
这是最核心的易错点，介词的选择本质是“看搭配对象”，分两种情况：

- **情况1：介词与先行词构成固定搭配**（先行词是搭配的核心）  
  易错原因：忽略先行词的固定介词搭配，误用其他介词。  
  正确逻辑：介词由先行词决定，如“在盒子里”是`in the box`、“关于这本书”是`about the book`、“原因”是`for the reason`。  
  ▶ 易错案例：  
  错误：I have a box **of which** I keep my personal things.（误用of，先行词box的固定搭配是in the box）  
  正确：I have a box **in which** I keep my personal things.  
  ▶ 拓展搭配：  
  - the city **in which** he lives（live in the city）  
  - the date **on which** we met（on the date）  
  - the reason **for which** he left（for the reason）

- **情况2：介词与从句中的动词/形容词构成固定搭配**（从句谓语是搭配的核心）  
  易错原因：介词紧跟关系代词时，容易遗漏从句动词的固定搭配。  
  正确逻辑：介词由从句中的动词（如talk about、depend on）或形容词（如afraid of、interested in）决定。  
  ▶ 易错案例：  
  错误：This is the book **which** we talked yesterday.（缺少介词about，talk是不及物动词，需搭配about才能接宾语）  
  正确：This is the book **about which** we talked yesterday.  
  ▶ 拓展搭配：  
  - the person **whom** she depends on → the person **on whom** she depends（depend on sb.）  
  - the film **which** he is interested in → the film **in which** he is interested（be interested in sth.）

- 避坑技巧：  
  遇到介词选择犹豫时，把从句还原成独立句子，看需要补充哪个介词才能完整表达意思。  
  例：从句还原为“I keep my personal things ___ the box” → 需补充in → 确定介词in。


易混点2：关系代词选择——which/whom/whose 怎么区分？
易错原因：混淆“指物/指人/所有格”的对应关系，尤其容易误用whose或省略关系代词。  
核心规则：  
| 指代对象 | 关系代词 | 是否需介词 | 易错提醒 |
|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| 物       | which    | 是（介词+which） | 不可用that替代（介词提前时） |
| 人       | whom     | 是（介词+whom） | 口语中可省略whom，把介词后置（如the person I talked to） |
| 人/物的所有格 | whose | 否（直接用whose，无需介词） | 易误写为“of which/whom”，需注意搭配差异 |

▶ 易错案例：  
1. 错误：This is the student **which** I worked with.（指人误用which，应选whom）  
   正确：This is the student **whom** I worked with / **with whom** I worked.  
2. 错误：He has a dog **of which** the tail is short.（所有格误用of which，可简化为whose）  
   正确：He has a dog **whose** tail is short.（whose直接修饰tail，无需介词）  
3. 错误：I have a friend **with who** I share my secrets.（whom不能用who替代，介词后需用宾格）  
   正确：I have a friend **with whom** I share my secrets.


易混点3：与关系副词（where/when/why）的替换——什么时候能换？什么时候不能换？
易错原因：盲目用where/when/why替代“介词+which”，忽略介词是否为“固定搭配中的必要成分”。  
核心对应关系（可替换场景）：  
- 地点先行词（place/city/box等）：in/at/on which = where  
  例：The office **in which** I work = The office **where** I work（我工作的办公室）  
- 时间先行词（day/date/year等）：in/at/on which = when  
  例：The day **on which** we met = The day **when** we met（我们相遇的那天）  
- 原因先行词（reason）：for which = why  
  例：The reason **for which** he left = The reason **why** he left（他离开的原因）

▶ 不可替换场景（易错提醒）：  
当介词不是“地点/时间/原因”的固定搭配，而是与从句动词构成特殊搭配时，不能用关系副词替代。  
  错误：This is the pen **where** I write.（write with the pen是动词搭配，介词with不可省略，不能用where）  
  正确：This is the pen **with which** I write / The pen (that) I write **with**.


易混点4：介词位置——到底放在“关系代词前”还是“从句末尾”？
易错原因：不清楚介词位置的规则，尤其容易在“正式/口语”场景中用错，或误省略关系代词。  
核心规则：  
1. 介词可放在“关系代词前”（正式书面语，关系代词不可省略）  
   例：The book **about which** we talked is popular.（不可说about that，that不能用于介词后）  
2. 介词可放在“从句末尾”（口语化表达，关系代词可省略，that/which均可）  
   例：The book (that/which) we talked **about** is popular.  
3. 易错禁忌：  
   - 介词提前时，不能用that替代which/whom：  
     错误：The person **about that** I told you is here.（that需改为whom）  
     正确：The person **about whom** I told you is here.  
   - 不能把介词放在关系代词和先行词之间：  
     错误：I have a box which **in** I keep things.（介词in需提前到which前）  
     正确：I have a box **in which** I keep things.


易混点5：固定短语中的介词——能否拆分提前？
易错原因：把“动词+介词”的固定短语（如look after、depend on、take care of）拆分，误将介词提前。  
核心规则：  
- 若短语是“不可拆分的固定搭配”（介词与动词结合紧密，单独拆分后语义改变或不成立），介词不能提前，只能放在从句末尾。  
  ▶ 易错案例：  
  错误：This is the child **after whom** I looked.（look after是固定短语，不可拆分）  
  正确：This is the child (that/whom) I looked **after**.  
- 若短语是“可拆分搭配”（介词仅为连接宾语，拆分后语义不变），介词可提前或后置。  
  例：This is the topic **about which** we discussed.（discuss about可拆分）= This is the topic (that) we discussed **about**.

▶ 常见不可拆分短语（需牢记）：  
look after（照顾）、take care of（照顾）、listen to（听）、depend on（依赖）、deal with（处理）、refer to（参考）、put up with（忍受）


二、总结：快速避坑口诀
1. 介词选择看“搭配”：先行词或从句动词，还原句子定介词；  
2. 代词选择看“指代”：物用which人用whom，所有格用whose（无介词）；  
3. 替换副词看“场景”：地点时间原因可替换，动词搭配不可换；  
4. 介词位置看“语体”：书面提前不省代，口语后置可省略；  
5. 固定短语看“拆分”：不可拆分不提前，拆分短语可灵活。


三、高频易错句对比（实战巩固）
| 错误句子 | 错误类型 | 正确句子 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| The house which we lived in last year is big.（无语法错，但可优化） | 口语化表达，书面语可提升 | The house **in which** we lived last year is big. |
| She is the girl about who I told you. | 介词后用who（应⽤whom） | She is the girl **about whom** I told you. |
| This is the tool which he worked with.（无语法错，固定搭配可拆分） | 可优化为书面语 | This is the tool **with which** he worked. |
| The reason which he left is unknown. | 缺少介词for（reason与for搭配） | The reason **for which** he left is unknown. / The reason **why** he left is unknown. |
| The team which we are cheering for is winning. | 固定短语cheer for不可拆分，无需提前介词 | The team (that) we are cheering for is winning.（不可说for which we are cheering） |

翻译：I'm not even all that hungry.

核心翻译
**我甚至没那么饿。**（口语化核心版）  
**我其实压根没那么饿。**（强化语气版）

深度解析（口语短语+语气+语境适配）
1. **核心短语精准拆解（口语高频考点）**  
   - **all that**：口语化程度副词短语，仅用于 **否定句/疑问句**，译为“那么、非常”，相当于 `very much` 或 `so`，但语气更随意自然，避免书面化的生硬感。  
     ▶ 用法拓展：  
     - 否定句：I’m not all that tired.（我没那么累。）  
     - 疑问句：Is the movie all that good?（这部电影有那么好看吗？）  
     - 肯定句不可用：× I’m all that happy.（需改为 I’m very happy.）  
   - **even**：置于be动词后、实义动词前，译为“甚至”，强化否定语气，暗含“出乎意料”（比如“本以为会饿，但实际不然”）。

2. **句式与语气逻辑**  
   句子为 **否定式主系表结构**，核心语气是“弱化自身需求/状态”，常用于以下场景：  
   - 拒绝食物时：别人劝你再吃点，你回应“我甚至没那么饿”（委婉拒绝）；  
   - 描述状态时：比如长时间没吃东西，但实际饥饿感不强，强调“状态超出预期”。  
   中文翻译通过“甚至”“压根”“没那么”等词，精准还原这种“轻否定+意外感”的口语语气，避免直译“我不是所有那样饿”的荒谬表达。

3. **易混点辨析**  
   - 区分 `all that` 与 `so that`：前者是程度副词短语（仅否定/疑问），后者是连词（表“以便”），如：I left early so that I could catch the bus.（我早走是为了赶车。）  
   - 区分 `all that` 与 `all the`：后者后接名词，表“所有的”，如：I ate all the cake.（我把蛋糕全吃了。）

场景化同义译法
- 口语委婉版：**我其实没那么饿啦。**（带撒娇/随和语气，适合朋友聚餐）  
- 日常简洁版：**我甚至都不太饿。**（中性表达，适配大多数口语场景）  
- 强调意外版：**没想到我压根没那么饿。**（突出“超出预期”，适合描述突发状态）

句式拓展与仿写（强化口语表达）
1. 仿写例句（保留 `not even all that` 结构）：  
   - She’s not even all that upset about the mistake.（她对这个错误甚至没那么生气。）  
   - The task isn’t even all that difficult.（这项任务甚至没那么难。）  
2. 同义替换拓展（口语灵活性）：

   - I’m not hungry at all, actually.（语气更强，“压根不饿”）
