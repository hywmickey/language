Let's go talk to the team's radio announcer to find out the details.
I have been doing Maryland football and basketball for 28 years.
I broadcast; I describe what I'm seeing on the radio.
I'm the eyes and the ears of the people who can't get here. 
Only 50,000 people can get in this stadium to watch this football game.
stadium: 体育场
So no matter where you are, you can listen to the game.
I think the game dictates the broadcast.
我认为比赛内容决定了转播（的走向 / 内容）。
dictate：支配、决定
	“dictate the terms（定条件）”“dictate the pace（掌控节奏）”。
	The market usually dictates the price of raw materials.（市场通常决定原材料的价格。）
	The quality of the script dictates how successful the movie will be.（剧本质量决定了这部电影会有多成功。）
When you have an exciting game, there's an exciting broadcast.

We could hear the sound of the crowd cheering on the radio.

    例句 2：We all cheered her on when she ran the marathon.（她跑马拉松时，我们都为她加油。）
What time will they broadcast the big game tonight?
Usually, the announcer sits in a booth which is called the press box.

I like this announcer. He always describes the smallest details.

Devin _to_ throw, he gets inside the 10-yard line.
德文能传球，他还能带球冲到 10 码线内。
    gets inside the 10-yard line：“10-yard line”（10 码线）是美式足球场地的关键标记（场地以码为单位，10 码线通常靠近对方端区，是得分的关键区域），“gets inside” 译为 “冲到…… 内”，体现球员通过奔跑或战术配合主动进入关键区域的动态感，准确传递 “向得分区推进” 的竞技意图。
Can you explain the game of football and tell us how it's played?
The object of the 11 guys is to move the ball as best they can, and to get in position to score as many points as they can.
这 11 个人的目标是尽全力推进球，并抢占位置以尽可能多得分数。
    The object of...：此处表示 “…… 的目标 / 目的”，日常也可替换为 “the goal of...” 或 “the aim of...”

You're right there in the press box, looking down at kids tackling, running, throwing.
你就在记者席上，低头看着孩子们（在场上）冲撞、奔跑、传球。
tackling：在运动语境中（尤其美式足球、橄榄球），指 “擒抱、冲撞”（阻止对方球员前进的动作）；若指足球，可译为 “铲球”，此处结合 “kids” 和 “running, throwing”，更可能是美式足球或校园球类运动，故优先译 “冲撞”。

American Football

American Football is a very popular sport that is watched by millions of people every year. American Football players need to train very hard in order to win games. It takes thought and planning, as well as strength and speed. A person needs to learn a lot about American Football before he or she can play. It is a fun sport, but it can also be very dangerous. There are a lot of rules that keep the game challenging and the players safe.

The Place where American Football is played is called the Gridiron or the Football Field. The playing area is 100 yards long. It is divided by stripes that make every five yards. The goals are at either end of the field. They are called End Zones. There are tall Goal Posts at each End Zone.

The best way for a team to score points is by getting the football into the other team's End Zone. This is called a Touchdown. Teams are make up of 46 players. During plays, there are eleven players on the field for each team. Teams are also divided into tow groups. These groups are the offensive group and the defensive group. Each player plays a special part in the team. In the offensive group, there are five major positions. These are the Quarterback, the Offensive Linemen, the Wide Receivers, the Tight Ends, and the Running Backs. In the defensive group, there are three major positions. These are the Defensive Liemen, the Defensive Backs, and the Linebackers. All players work together in order to win the game. There are also Special Groups of players whose job it is to make Field Goals. There are the Punter and the Place Kicker. This group is also know as the Special Team.

The offensive group tries to get the football into the defensive group's End Zone. They have four chances for every ten yards. Once they get ten yards closer to the End Zone, they get another four chances. This is called a Down. One way to try and get the football ten yards closer is to run it there. One player can hard the ball to another player to run with it. This is called a Handoff. The player could also throw backwards to player behind him. This is called a Lateral. The player with the ball then tries to run as far as he can with it. This is called Rushing. Another way is for one player to pass it to another player who has run forward. This is called a Forward Pass. Every new attempt starts where the ball was left off, This is called the Line of Scrimmage. If the offensive group fails to advance the football ten yards after four tries, the other team becomes the offensive.

If the offensive group scores a touchdown, it earns six points for its team. They also have another chance to score extra points after a touchdown. This is called a Conversion. It happens two yard from the defensive group's End Zone. There are two ways they can do this. One way is to score a Field Goal by kicking the football between the gaol posts. This earns one point. Another way is to try and run or pass the football into the End Zone. This earns two points. The entire game is made up of the four Quarters. Each Quarter is fifteen minutes long. In the end, the team with the most points is the winner.

Part of keeping other player from scoring is to knock them down. This is called Tackling. Because tackling can be very dangerous, there are many rules in American Football. If players break the rules, there are punishment. There are called Penalities. Most rules are made up to keep players from hurting each other. They also try to prevent cheating or unfair plays. Penalties can include moving the game closer to the End Zone or starting over from the beginning of the play. These rules help make American Football a fun sport to play and watch. The rules for Professional American Football may be a little bit different from College or High School Football. Still, they all bring huge crowds of fans to cheer their favorite teams.
