So she's the other woman! I can't belive it.
I don't want to see anymore, Roger.
You said you loved me!
You don't love me, Roger!
You don't know what that word means!
I love your hair, and your eyes.
Why don't you go back to Susan?
She's much better than me!
What are you talking about?

I need to speak to you, Kristi! Let me in.
You know how much I need you.
I said go away!
Stay away from me!
Get this man out of my room, will you?
Get out of my way!(让开)

Why do I always go out with bastards like him?
Why can't I find a man who respects me?

You heared what I said.
I saw you, Roger.
You were with Kristi.
I just had a business lunch with her, that's all.
She wanted to talk about business idea.
Let me tell you what happened?
Kirsti and I went out together, but it's over now.
And that's the truth. Please belive me.
You can call Kristi and ask her. If you don't belive me.
How can I possibly call Kristi?
Why don't we have a vacation and start over?
I want a divorce, Roger, and I never want to see you again.
You only married me, because my father's the CEO of the airline.
You just married me to get a job.
I'll call the police!
Go on then, call them!
OK Susan, calm down. Please belive me.
You don't love me and you never loved me.
That's not true.

I loved him before, but I don't anymore.
I had an appointment at 10:00.
He just married his wife to get a visa.
I don't know what happened.
Kayo went out with Yuji last year.
Christophe wanted to start a new company.
I saw my wife with another man.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was with a client.
I heard a great band last night.

I love him. I want to see him again.
I love your eyes. They're beautiful.
I never want to see you again.
It's over now, I want a divorce.
Max and I aren't together now. He went back to his girlfried.
I married him because I love him.
I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore.
We went out together.

Why do I always go out with bastards like him?
You don't love me. You don't know what the word means.
You can call her if you don't believe me.
I need a woman who respects me.

I don't love you. Please go away!
Kristi, please come back!
I must see Kristi. Call her immediately!
I need to see you. Please let me in!
Help! Get this man out of my room!
Get out of my way!
I'm not with Kristi anymore. Please belive me!
Get out, Roger! Or I'll call the police!

You know how much I need a job.
I said, I need a job!
Why don't you call your friend Peter?
It's true! Please believe me!
Please calm down.
What are you talking about?
I want to tell you the truth.
I want you out of this office immediately.

Are you paying by card?
No, by cash.

Let's go and choose some clubs.

Keep going.
You have to hold higher than that.
Let me show you.
This is the best way to learn.

That was good. Keep going.
OK, this is a good way to learn.
See? Hold the club high, like this.
Now move it like this.
You got it into the hole! Great!

This dress is expensive. I need to find a cheaper one.
Your club is very low. Hold it higher.
Our teacher is good. But the teacher we had before was better!

I like the subway, but let's get a cab. It's quicker.
Put some sugar in your tea. It'll be sweater.

You're not usually so late to class. 
My friends don't usually listen to rock music.
Oh, I usually dance better than this.
I don't often eat in restaurants.
We never travel by bus.
Do you often by new programs?

She's very pretty. She's more beautifu than I am.
It's going to be warm day. I think it will be hotter than yesterday.
A: Is he a gentle man? B: Oh, yes. He's nicer than my toher boyfriend.
A: This isn't a good hotel. B: That's true. But, the other hotel was worse than this one!
I don't make clothes for young women. I make clothes for more mature women.
I often go out alone. I'm more independent than my friends.
Let's go to the Chinese restaurant. It's nearer to the office than the Italian restaurant.
