Did you see a young man here a moment ago?
No, of course not.
I've just come in.
I thought I saw a yong man.
I was right; I did see a young man!
I told you there was a young man around.

I've got some slivovitsa.
it's a Romanian drink, a bit like brandy, but it's made from plums.
It's strong, isn't it?
I haven't got anyting to drink, I'm afraid. Not even coffee.
It's all right, I'm not thirsty.

Try to get to sleep.
How can I get to sleep with that noise?
Are they having a party, or something?
My wife gets very excited(受刺激的；紧张不安的).
Maybe if you try to be quieter...
Now, but you close the door, please.

I've invited a friend to have a drink with me.
And it's not your business, anyway.
Maybe it's better if I go now.
You don't have to go, Marco.
Why don't we go to your place?
You have to get up early tomorrow, don't you?

I didn't expect to see you（我没想到会见到你）.
Do I have to make an appointment, then?
Do I have to call you secretary and ask: May I see Mr.Benini for five minutes sometime?
And I thought we were friends.


I thought I saw a young man.
I told you I heard a noise.
I thought we were friends.
Mary thought Kristi was Marco's girlfriend.
The receptionist told Kristi she could have her key.

Let's see what there is to drink.
I've got some slivovitsa.
It's a Romanian drink.
It's like brandy.
It's made from plums.
Ooh! It's strong, isn't it?
I've invited a friend to have a drink with me.
I haven't got anything to drink. Not even coffee.
I'm not thirsty.

I told you I saw a young man.
No, of course not.
Don't worry about it.
No, please don't!
All right, we'll try.
Yeah, soure, I like opera.
Of course, we're friends.
I was right, I did see a young man.
The elevator is the other way.

I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
I'm sorry, but I have to be careful.
My wife doesn't sleep well, and she gets very excited.
I'm not tired anymore. Let's go. It'll be fun.
Safe at last!
I'm glad she's gone.

I certainly do want to complain.
I'm complaining about something else.
I am complaining about the person next door in room 38.
she had a young man in her room, and made a terrible noise.
I am going to change hotels.
Are you sure? I am quite sure. thank you!

Hi Kristi, 
Look, I'm very soory about what happened the other night. I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me; I don't have hundreds of girlfriends.
In face, I don't have a girlfriend at all at the moment; Mary is just a friend, that's all. I didn't expect to see her that night; we didn't have a date, or anything. I mean it(我是认真的); please belive me.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I really like you a lot, Kristi. I had a very good time at the match with you. What happened at your hotel and back here was all really quite funny, wasn't it? I hope we can forget about it all and try again soon.
I remember you said that you like opera. Well, I've brought two tickets for Puccini's Madam Butterfly next Friday. I hope you can come; I've thought about you a lot sice the other evening.
Call me or email me to let me know.
Hope to see you again soon. Marco Benini.

Did I see you at school?
Julio invited Nadine to the party.
She got excited about her new car.
I came to visit my friend.
I am sorry about what happened last night.
I wanted to tell you I like you.
I told you I saw the teacher at the restaurant.
I had a good time at the match yesterday.
I bought two tickets to the opera.
I didn't know you were here. I thought you were at the hotel.
