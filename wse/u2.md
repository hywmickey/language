Did they really think I was going to stay in the car?
I thought Mr. P. would try to kill me, the bastard!
I was just thinking, you see.
As you haven't got anywhere to stay.
I was wondering if you'd like to move into the apartment while I'm away.
Gee, I don't know how to thank you.
She just wanted to give me her new address, that's all.
I thought you said she was away on vacation.
“said she” 在口语中通常连读为 /sedʃi/
I'm going to find out what the hell she thinks she's doing!

I'd just like to move out one or two antiques and items of furniture.
Would you mind giving me a hand?
I'm always happy to help a friend.
You'll go back with him, won't you?

What are you doing sitting on the sidewalk?
They've thrown me out of my apartment!
If I had a job I'd have some money, and if I had some money I'd pay the rent, wouldn't I?
It would be a good idea if you got in touch with me.

Hello, Hugo, back from your vacation?
Someone's sent me a postcard from Trinidad!
"Having a great time in Trinidad, but Mr. P hasn't been very helpful so far."

He's certain to try and get her back.
他肯定会设法把她找回来。
You'll go back with him, won't you?
Let's take a vote on it, then.
Who's for keeping him out? One, two, three.
And who's against? Only Annie.
That's decided, by a majority of three to one.
You'll go back with him, won't you?
Back to a nice safe job as some rich bastard's secretary.
回到一份不错的安全工作，做某个有钱混蛋的秘书。

I can't leave my TV here.
What if someone stole it?
What if Annie comes around looking for you?
She's still away in Sweden, on cacation.

"Dear Daddy, I've finally decided to do the right thing, and to live the life that's right for me."
She's walked out!
Everything's going wrong!


Did Hugo really think Roger was dead?
Did they really think Roger was going to stay in the car?
I thought Mr.P would try to kill me.
I was wondering if you'd like to move into the aparment?
Did you believe that Annie was going to move to Sweden?
I was wondering if you would like to have dinner with me somethime?
We were going to Trinidad on holiday, but we changed our plans.
Hey! I thought that he was going to Australia!

If John had some money, he'd pay the rent.
If John had a job, he wouldn't be unemployed.
If Annie got in touch with Hugo, he'd know what she is doing.
If John had more friends, he wouldn't be so longly.
If you were here, we could go out for dinner.
I'd tell you if I saw him.
People could call John if he had a phone.
I'd go out with him if he asked me.


Back from your cacation, Hugo?
Having a great time in Trinidada.
Doing you shopping today, are you?
Hey, got any milk?
Writing a postcard?
See you later this evening!
Take care , okay?
Love you, honey!
See what I mean?

I want to live the life that's right for me.
I'll never go back to that way of life!
我再也不会回到那种生活方式了！

He's certain to try to get in touch with me.
You have to arrive on time every day at work.
I look forward to having dinner with you tomorrow.
Been working hard?
You must get in touch with her immediately!
I was wondering if you'd like to help me carry some boxes.
I can't help you right now. I've got to take out the trash.
“I've got to” 翻译为 “我必须”，更口语化， 与 “I have to” 语义完全相同
I don't want to go to a movie tonight.
I feel like calling my mother.
Raising children is a hard job.

Have they kidnapped you or something?
他们把你绑架了还是怎么着？
There's a diner just around the block, we'll go there.
Would you mind giving me some sort of explanation?
I'll tell you everything when we get to the diner.
It's only a short way's away.
This glass is filthy, would you mind bringing me a clean one, please?
They don't even wash the dishes properly.

This place looks totally disgusting!
What are you having?
Please yourself.
toast and coffee.
a bottle of orange juice.
I have an egg, over easy.
我要一只两面煎的鸡蛋。
We don't do bottles we only do cans.
toast and coffee.
Here's your egg and toast, Coffee's coming up.

Please don't talk to me as if I was a child, I'm grown up now, I'm almost twenty-four years old, and I see things differently from when I was a child.
When I was younger, I used to think you were some kind of superman!
I used to think, "I've got such a clever Daddy, he makes so much money, and we live in such a lovely apartment, and we go on all these expensive vacations."
It's just that I've grown up now, and I see things differently from when I was a child.
As I said, I'm an adult now, not a child.
I hate to say this, but I don't want to become like you.
Just try to see it my way.
They don't even wash the dishes properly.
You're such a snob!
snob:势利小人
So it's snobbish to want to be clean, is it?
所以爱干净还成势利眼了，是吧？

For you happiness just means having lots of money, doesn't it?
And what's so terrible about having money?
I'd be very happy to buy you whatever you wanted.
And I'm not going to go and marry some successful robot, that I don't care about!
Did I say anything when you broke up with Martin?
I've heard enough of this nonsense! I'm going!
我听够了这些废话！我要走了！
I suppose your boyfriend has taught you all this nonsense.
我猜这些无稽之谈都是你男朋友教你的。
I've seen what it's done to you.
我已经看到它给你造成的影响了。
I'm sorry about some of the things I said.
You said exactly what I thought you'd say.

Don't you care anymore what I think or what I feel?
I don't know how to say this, and I can see things now that I couldn't see then.
我不知道该怎么说，但现在我能看清以前看不到的东西了。

Let me remind you what my horrible money has done for you.
You did that very expensive interpreters' course, and I paid for it.
I didn't understand what was going on in those days.


John, would you mind talking out the garbage?
Annie, would you mind giving me a good explanation?
Would they mind sitting next to us?
Does Hugo mind if Annie moves away?
Do they mind if we smoke?
No, I don't mind if you do.
Would you mind bringing me a clean glass?
Please! Would you mind speaking more quietly?

This is such a terrible restaurant!
I've never seen such dity glasses!
This orange is so fresh because it isn't from a can!
He used to be so thin, but now he's very fat!
He's such a fat man!
You're such an incredible father!
It's so hot! Please open a window!
That woman is so funny!

if you want breakfast, there's a diner just around the block.
Could I have a cup of coffee, please?
Yes, and I would like toast with butter, and one fried egg please.
How would you like your egg cooked, madam?
Over easy, please.
What are you having, Sir?
Just a bottle of orange juice, please.
Here's your toast, coming up!
这是您的吐司，马上来！

The diner looks disgusting!
Hugo will eat anything the dinner hasn't made themselves.
This glass is filthy so the waitress bings Hugo a clean one.
This diner is awful! They don't wash the dishes properly.
Hugo wanted Annie to live in a clean evrironment.

Annie used to live with her father, but now she lives with her friends.
I really used to like him, but now I don't.
Sandra used to work at a bank unitl she quit her job.
She used to think her boyfriend was amazing until she saw him with another woman.
I didn't use to ride a bike unitl somebody stole my car.
They used to go on vacation every year, but now they can't because of the children.
We used to buy our food at the supermarket until we found out it was cheaper at the farmer's market.
He used to be overweight, but then he started working out.

You shouldn't speak to teenagers as if they were children!
When I was younger, I used to think you were the best father in the world!
But now that I've grown up, I see things very differently.
I'm not a kid, I'm almost 24 years old.
When I was young I used to think that money could buy happiness!
Now I'm an adult I understand that many things matter to me more than money.
In those days we used to go on expensive vacations very summer.

The Marlborough Hotel 875 Fourth Avenue 10021 New York
Dear Annie,
As I haven't hear anything from you for quite a while, I thought I'd write you this letter, just to give you my latest news.
I'm still in the hotel, as you can see. I've left someone to look after the apartment while the men are working on it.
It's a bit lonely, really, staying in this hotel, when I think about the good old days when we were living together in the apartment.
I got another postcard from David, by they way, he and Juanita have gong to Peru. I don't think they'll be back in New York until next month. They both send you their love, anyway.
The point is this, Annie, I understand that you've got to live your won life, and if you don't feel like living with your old Dad anymore, well, that's perfectly understandable too.
It's just that it would be nice to hear from you every now and then, if only to know that you're all right. Surely that's not much to ask?
Well, that's all for now, Annie. Please get in touch soon, you can get me either at the office or here. Looking forward to hearing from you.
All my love, Daddy.

Would you mind telling me why you did that?
What do you talk to me as if I was ten years old?
This house wouldn't be so filthy if you cleaned if more often!
They were only twenty years old, but they acted as if they were much older.
If you leave him a message, I'm sure he'll call you back.\
Would you mind if we went to another restaurant?
If you wanted to go on vacation, I'd be happy to give you some money.
I wouldn't go back there even if he asked me.
即使他邀请我，我也不会回去。
He keeps buying expensive stuff, as if had a lot of money.
If he asks you, don't tell him you saw me.

| I'm not going to marry some someone just because he has money! | I never said I wanted you to do that!                        |
| Sorry, Dad. I used to think you were clever, but now I see things differently. | Look Annie, I'm sorry about some of the things I said.       |
| Yeah, well, you said exactly what I thought you'd say.       | Well, I guess that means we know each other well, at leaset. |

So it's all my fault, is it?
How was I supposed to know that Petri wasn't on that plane?
I suppose I'd better go out and do some shopping.
I'll have a look at myself.
My God! I look awful.
I suppose I'll have to wash my face, and put on some makeup.
I don't feel like it! I don't feel like anything!
Do you still find me attractive?
Or are you starting to find me horrible and ugly?
I hate myself!
I'll just take a couple of pills and go to sleep.
I just want to forget about everything!

I've got to go back to Trinidad!

It's down to me to sort it out again!
又得靠我来解决这事了！
sort out: 整理；解决（问题）
I've got to sort this out now or I could lose my job.

I'll have to pack a suitcase and run.
I'll take this light cotton suit, and these ties, and this shirt, and this one, and a pair of black shoes, and a few pairs of socks.
cotton suit: 棉质西装，
I'll just get my washing and shaving things, razor, soap, towel.
You don't mind if I take the shampoo, do you?
toothpaste... toothbrush...

Look love, this really isn't the right moment.
There's nothing to talk about.
So would you like me to go on as if I didn't care?
那你是想让我装作毫不在意，继续这样下去吗？
As if it didn't matter to me whether you're here or not?
I'm going to miss that plane if I don't leave right now.

I'll have to go to the pharmacy and get some more.
Yes, I'd like 50 more of these.
I'm sorry, you can only get them by prescription.
You'll have to go to your doctor for another one.


How was I supposed to know that Petri wasn't on that plane?
我怎么会知道Petri不在那架飞机上呢？
You were supposed to catch Petri, Peters, not chat with him.
I was supposed to be there at 8 o'clock. I'm going to be late!
I suppose you want to know what happend.
I suppose I should go home. It's late.
Susan, you were supposed to go to the doctor's today. Did you forget?
Yes, he's supposed to be in prison, but he's escaped.

OK, so I'll need to shave when I'm there. Where's my razor?
I think I'll take some soap. I don't like washing my face with that cheap stuff they give you in hotels.
You don't mind if I take the shampoo, do you? I'll need to wash my hair.
Do you know where the tie that goes with my suit is?
“go with” : “与…… 相配、搭配”
I can't forget to bring my toothbrush and, of course, the toothpaste.
It's so hot in the Caribbean. I'd better take my cotton suit off.
OK, I have all my clothes ready. Now, I can pack my suitcase.

So it's all my fault, is it?
I'll show you. You'll see what a good police officer I am!
They won't get away from me this time. No way!
I wasn't expecting what bloody Thacker said to me either!
我也没料到那个该死的萨克会对我说那种话！
So, it's down to me to solve thie problem again.
I've got to sort this out now or I could lose my job.
Look, I'm not going there on vacation, damn it!
How was I supposed to know that I couldn't go in that place?

I can't just go on as if I didn't care, when I love you so much!
You know how much I hate you gong away. You can't expect me to act as if didn't matter.
He behaves as if he as in his twenties, but he's almost forty.
Why is she all dressed up as if she was going for tea with the Queen?

Harry doesn't like talking about problems, he just goes on as if everything was fine between him and Susan.
It's July already, but it's as cold as if it was still winter.
Don't talk to me as if I was a child, I'm nearly twenty!
The team aren't playing well, it's as if they didn't care whether they win or not.

My hair! My face! My God! I look awful!
I should wash my face, but I don't feel like it.
Just drinking, that's the only thing I'm good for!
Do you still think I'm attractive, or do you fine me horrible and ugly?
Just a friend? So that's all I mean to him!
Why do I feel so bad? What's the matter with me?
I just want to forget about everything!

Look at yourself! You're so dirty!
I think Hilda's a little strange, because she always talks to herself.
I want to kill myself! I did something really stupid!
Susan is telling herself that Harry has another woman.
He thinks he's so cute. He should look at himself in the mirror!
Why do you hate yourself so much?
Oliver and Harold gave themselves a big party for their 40th birthday.
We should ask ourselves why we worry so much about what we look like.
There's coffee in the kitchen. You and Andrea can serve yourselves.

I think I will take for pairs.
It never gets cold in Trinidad.
Just two pairs, I think, after all, I only be there for two days.

Let's say goodbye now, because I won't see you again before I leave.
Oh God! Look at me! I look awful! Too much to drink again last night...
There are my glasses! What the hell were they doing there?
Ricently, the area has attaracted a lot of tourists.
Last month, we flew from London to New York with British Airways.
They spent thousands of dollars on their daughter's wedding last year.
I am going to miss my train if I don't leave right now.
Are you coming to my party tonight?
You never listen to me, do you?
All you ever do these days is talk, talk, talk.

Yes, I went to the dentist last week.
I had a filling.
我补了牙.
So your teeth don't hurt anymore,then?
Is there anything else which could stop you from sleeping?
Have you injured yourself in any way?
But you're still having difficulty in sleeping?
Do you think there could be psychological reasons?
I'm tired and fed up, and I just want to sleep, and forget everything!
I think you could do with someone to talk to. 
could do with需要;渴望得到
I'll make you an appointment with a colleague of mine.
She's a really understaning and caring person.
她是个非常理解且关心他人的人。
She's a psychiatrist.

Do you think I'm going crazy, then?
Is that why you're sending me to a psychiatrist?
Dont't think of her as a pyschiatrist, just think of her as someone to talk to.
Dr. Hargreaves told me about you.
Why do you keep asking me questions?
How do you feel about me asking you questions?

I just wanted some pills to get to sleep, that's all.
Is there anything wrong with that?
Do you think there's anyting wrong with it?
Why do you keep asking me questions?
How do you fee about me asking you questions?
You husband's gone away.
You husband's in prison.
Well, not exactly.
嗯，不完全是
Not exactly your husband, or not exactly in prison?
Sorry, I'm not quite with you. Who's a detective?
抱歉，我有点跟不上。谁是侦探？
Harry is my fiance!
And what's your role in all this?
That's right, he is a detective.
Your fiance is trying to catch your husband?
That's right. He's a detective.
When your fiance has caught your husband, he - your fiance will come back to you?
Harry isn't having an affair.
哈利没有出轨。
Roger had an affair with Kristi, before Harry arrested him.
Is Kristi a man or a woman?
Why, you don't think Roger's gay, do you?


Think of Dr. Cranston as someone to talk to.
Don't think of her as a pyschiatrist.
How do you feel about me asking you questions?
How do you feel about me talking you out for dinner? Do you want to?
Do you think of his as a friend or a boyfriend?
They don't think of him as a very good president, I'm afraid.
How does Susan feel about her best friend stealing her husband? Does she hate her?
We don't think of them as friends, really - just people who live in the same street as us.

I never feel happy. I always seem to be depressed and fed up.
I don't know what's the matter with me. Perhaps I'm going crazy.
The doctor thinks I could do with someone to talk to.
A psychiatrist is a doctor who treats people with mental health problems.
I think you have a psychological problem, not a physical one.
If you want to know how good a doctor is, ask his or her patients.
She's such a caring doctor, she always takes time to listen to her patients.

Not exactly your husband, or not exactly in prison?
Sorry, Mrs. Petri, who's Harry?
Sorry, I'm not quite with you.
And what's your role in all this?
What do you mean?
Sorry, I've lost you again.
抱歉，我再次没听明白。

Have you been to see a dentist?
Have you jnjured yourself in any way?

My fiance and I are getting married next month!
We're not getting on well, we're having a lot of difficulty in communicating with each other.
She's really mat at her husband, she's just found out he's having an affair with his secretary.
Divorce can be awful, especially when there are children involved.
They're getting divorced - she's fallen in love with her Spanish teacher.
Marriage isn't easy, but you should try to make it work, if only for the children.
婚姻并非易事，但你仍应努力维系，哪怕只是为了孩子。

NEW YORK CITY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES CONSULTATION REPORT NAME OF PATIENT: Mrs. Susan Petri
Mrs. Petri, who is a patient of Dr. Hargreaves, come to see me complaining that she could not get to sleep.
Dr. Hargreaves had explained to me that, in his opinion, she had psychological problems, and needed to talk to a pyschiatric professional.
As far as I can see, Mrs. Petri is not yet ready to talk about her problems openly.
I offered her the chance to do so, but she chose instead to tell me a long story about detectives and prisoners, of which I found it very difficult to understand more than a small part.
Like many lonely people, she probably watches too much television, and has difficulty in telling the difference between crime movies and the reality of her own life.
When Mr.s Petri left my office she said that she was perfectly all right, and did not even accept my offer of a prescription for sleeping pills.
I do not think she is in any immediate danger, but I would advise Dr.Hargreaves to keep a close eye on her.
Maureen Cranston.

The prescription that I have is out of date, so I can't use it.
Is there anything else which could stop you from sleeping?
Your fiance is trying to catch you husband who's escaped from prision. Is that right?
Dr. Cranston, who is a well-know pyschiatrist, is a very understanding person.
Mrs. Petri, whos is a patient of Dr. Hargreaves, came to see me complaining that she couldn't get to sleep.
Dr. Hargreaves, who knows her well, said that Mrs. Petri had pyschological problems.
She told me a long stroy, which I found very difficult to understand.
When Mrs. Petri left my office she didn't accept the prescription I offered her.
There are plenty of people who go to see psychiatrists, it dosn't mean you're crasy.
The only thing I don't understand is why she didn't give me a prescription.

What is Kristi's apartment like? It's dirty and almost completely unfurnished.
Where is John? in the apartment next door.
How does Kristi know John? They went out on a date.
他们出去约会了。
Why do the two big guys attack Marco? They think he's Hugo Peters.
What reason does Hugo give Mr. P for not being at home? He doesn't want Mr. P's men to find him.
What does Mr. P think has happened to Roger Petri? He thinks Petri is dead.
What does Hugo offer to get for Mr. P? drugs.

I don't cook that often, but I am quite good at it.
I am sure it's the only thing you are good at.
Perhaps we should sit somewhere more comfortable...

The place is completely empty apart from this table and chairs.
It is a strange apartment, with this dark brown ceiling and light brown walls.
The place looks like it was last cleaned about 20 years ago.
Whoever lived here before was a total pig!
Sounds like there's someone knocking on your door.

I wasn't expecting___ anyone.
I thought I'd come and pick up my magazines.
Hey, what do you know, it's Kristi!
嘿，你猜怎么着！是克丽丝蒂！

Stay away from me.
Please don't hurt me!
You can have my watch.
Help! Put me down!
Very clever of you, Peters.
But your "visitors" will find you in the end.
Very well, I'll accept your offer.
But this stuff had better be really good... or else!
但这些东西最好真的很好……否则就惨了！

Whatever it is you've come to get, could you take it and go, please?
不管你来拿什么，能不能拿了东西就走？
Those gross magazines are yours, are they?
那些低俗杂志是你的，是吗？
I almost threw them in the trash this morning.
They're over there, in that wardrobe.

You can have my watch.
It was given to me by my grandfather.
This used to be my apartment, unitl I was thrown out for not paying the rent.

The Boss didn't say anything about a woman, he just said we should get rid of Hugo Peters.
Hugo used to live next door.

Could I have a word with the Boss, please?
Hold on.
What a pleasant surprise!
I'd like you to give me another chance.
我希望你再给我一次机会。
Give me one good reason why I should.


This place is so dirty. It looks like it was last cleaned about 20 years ago.
You look like you didn't sleep at all last night. Are you OK?
Something's not right. It feels like something terrible is going to happen.
Do you hear that music? It sounds like there's a party next door.
See how dark the sky is? Looks like it's going to rain.
It's so hot for March. It feels like summer already.
Listen to Olivia shouting. It sounds like she's really mad.

Whoever has moved into my old apartment can give me the magazines I left there.
I'm not going to go out on a date with you again, whatever you say to try and persuade me.
Whoever it is knocking on the door, tell them to go away. I don't want to see anyone right now.
If you you're hungry, please help yourself to whatever you want from the fridge.

The place is completely empty apart from this table and chairs, and the bed ...
It is a strange apartment, I must say, with this dark brown ceiling and these light brown walls.
Where's that music coming from? Gee, it's next door!
Your magazines are in that wardrobe. Take them away, please!

The apartment was cleaned about 20 years ago.
It was given to me by my grandfather.
I was thrown out for not paying the rent.
He was invited to the party by Hugo.
They were attacked by two men with guns.
We were told to arrive on time.

Who on earth is that?
Oh my God, it's you!
Hey, what do you know, it's Kristi!
Peters, it's you. What a pleasant surprise!
Mary, what a nice surprise!

Open up! We know you're there!
开门！我们知道你在里面！
There he is! Let's get him!
Put me down!
Please don't hurt me!
Stay away from me!
You can have my watch, just don't do anything to me!
你拿我的手表吧，只求别伤害我！
If they really want to find you, they will in the end.
要是他们真的想找你，最终总会找到你的。
You'd better bring me the money tomorrow, or else!

Apartment 3C, 724 West End Avenue February 11th
Dear Mom,
I thought I'd just write you a letter to tell you how I'm doing, as it's quite a long time since I last saw you.
As you can see, I've moved, but only to the next apartment. I decided to leave my old apartment. It was really getting much too small for me, and I'm staying here for the moment while I'm looking for anther one.
Do you remember Mr. Peters, that real nice and polite old guy who used to live next door to me? Well, he very kindly said I could stay in his apartment while he was away on business. Wasn't that nice of him?
Unfortunately, he took all his furniture away with him, and for some reason the phone doesn't work, either. Perhaps he forgot to pay the bill!
Now, about my work, I decided to leave that job with the oil company, and move into the music and entertainment business. I'm having a very interesting time, and what do you know? I saw Clive the other week!
I took one of my groups down to New Camford to play in his club. Everybody enjoyed themselves very much and asked us to come again.
Well, that's all for now. Look after yourself, Mom.
See you soon, All my love, John.

Whoever cleaned this room didn't do a very good job - it's very dirty still.
I was given some beautiful flowers by a group of students.
Using the internet used to be a lot slower before the technology improved.
How many books have you got there? It looks like you've been studying very hard!
I don't think I can save my marriage now, whatever I try to do.
Listen! It sounds like there's a train coming.
Did you use to have long hair, when you were a child!
My new car was made in Germany. German cars are the best!
It looks like it's going to be a beautiful day - there isn't a could in the sky.
I used to drink wine, but now I don't.

My old apartment was too small for me, so I moved out.
I was able to stay in a friend's apartment while she was away.
Someone's already moved into my old apartment.
The only problem is that the wardrobe is too small for me to put all my clothes in.
I hate cleaning, so I get someone to come in twice a week.
I decided to rent an apartment, I'm not ready to buy anywhere yet.
I painted the ceiling dark blue, and the walls light blue, so they go together.
Why's the phone bill so high this month? Who have you been calling?
Her apartment isn't very comfortable. There's not even a sofa to sit on!
Hi! I'm your new neighbor. I've just bought the house next door.

What about our equipment?
It's___ all been looked after, hasn't it?
All the equipment, and all your luggage have been send on.
Where are you going, if you don't mind me asking?
We're going to Trinidad for a music festival.

What kind of car would you like, sir?
Sedan or station wagon?
轿车还是客货两用车？
We have Nissans, VWs and Fords.
我们有日产、大众和福特。
Or would you prefer a Mercedes for a little extra luxury?

随便一辆车都行，给我一辆日产轿车。
Would you like your Nissan with or without a sunroof?
你想要有天窗的日产还是没有天窗的日产？

Will you be paying by credit card?
关键语法点：将来进行时（Will be doing）的用法
此处不用简单的 “Will you pay...（一般将来时）”，而是用将来进行时，核心目的是弱化 “询问” 的压迫感，增强礼貌性。传递 “只是确认一下，不打扰你做决定” 的委婉态度。
I'll just go and process this card, sir.
Won't be a moment!
马上就好！

I don't want to become a member of any club.
I don't want anything, except a car.
Can I just pay for it and take it away, please?


I'm sorry about what happened that evening we went to Syracuse.
It wouldn't happen if we went there again, would it?
They'd listen to us this time, wouldn't they?
Not that I'd want to go there again, of course.

It's a radio! I wonder if it's got any batteries in it?
and this weeks number one, all aross the nation, is Nervous Equipment, with "Suicide Jive."
本周全美范围内的冠军，是 Nervous Equipment，他们凭借歌曲《Suicide Jive》登顶。
Can I come too?
It doesn't make any difference to me.

We have now reached our maximum cruising height of 10,000 meters.
That's way high, isn't it?
Let me just work it out.
让我来算一下。
It's about 15,000 miles. 

I've just been given this new phone.
It hasn't got a keyboard, or any keys.
You just touch the screen with this pen-type thing.
你只要用这支笔状的东西触碰屏幕就可以了。
Every time you touch the screen it makes a little sound.
You can even watch movies on it!

Would you mind not smoking, please?
Relax, you are making mi__ nervous!
You don't mind if this gentleman sits here, do you, Wart?
你不介意这位先生坐这儿吧，沃特（狗名）？


Everything has been looked after.
All the equipment and luggage have been send on.
Look, I've just been given a new phone.
It hasn't been used yet, it's still in its box.
All our cars have been rented out, we don't have any left.
Your luggage has already been packed.
We can't go, the bill hasn't been paid yet.

I'm sorry about what happend that night we went out to dinner at Renzo's.
It wouldn't happen if we went there again, would it?
They'd serve us the right dishes this time, wouldn't they?
And they wouldn't make us pay for the wrong dishes, either.
Well, not that I'd want to go back there anyway.
not that: 并不是说，并非
But, if we went, the service would probably be better.

The plan has now reached its maximum cruising height.
That plane is flying very high, isn't it?
The cruising altitude is 10,000 meters.
巡航高度为10,000米。
Ten thousand meters is 6.5 miles.
We bought a few pounds of apples.
There are two liters of soda in this bottle.
I had to put in 20 gallons of gas.

I wonder if the radio has any batteries in it.
It hasn't got a keyborad or any keys.
Every time you touch the screen it makes a little sound.
You don't touch it with your fingers. You use this pen-type thing.
You can even watch movies on it.
I've just been given this new phone.

I'll have a sedan.
two door will be fine, thanks.
I think I'll choose the second one.
I'm not sure, let's say four days.

We wouldn't fail if we studied, would we?
They'd listen to their teachers next time, wouldn't they?
Not that I'd want to go there again, but if I did, I'd visit more museums.
The rooms have all been cleaned, haven't they?
All the books have been returned to the library.
I've just been given this new hat by a friend.
You just touch the screen with this, like, pen-type thing.
Will you be paying by credit card?
He wouldn't be late if he watched the clock.
I've just been told I can go to school in the United States.

What does John do at the fruit farm? He switches on the wrong thing.
Why is Harry happy about what happened? His problem is solved.

Take your shoes and socks off, Peters.
You heard what I said!
Guards, Get him.
Put one foot at a time into the water.
一只脚接着一只脚地踏入水中。
at a time: 每次，依次
Get him out of here immediately·
They're not much use, are they?
Perhaps, we can make a deal.

How would you like it if I came to your country and started an explosion?
How would you like it if your house was destroyed?
I didn't mean it that way.
我不是那个意思。
There's nothing left for me to do here.
我在这里没什么可做的了。

There's the equipment, all set up at last.
设备终于都准备好了。
Here's the plug, but where am I supposed to plug it in?
I'll go over to the fruit farm, maybe I'll find some kind of soket there.

There doesn't seems to be anybody around.
And I can't see any sockets either.
"No entry"
禁止入内
Oh well, let's see what's inside.
It seems to be full of computers and things.
这里似乎到处都是电脑和其他东西。
There's a socket. I can plug in the equipment.
plug in: 给…接通（电源）
Look like nothing's happened.
I'll have to find a switch.
That one over there seems to be the beggest one.

Well, the concert takes place in that field next to them.
嗯，音乐会就在他们旁边的那块空地上举行。
Of course we haven't missed it.
We're here to set up the equipment.
Wake me up when you're ready for the sound check.
To check that the sound's all right.
You don't seem to know very mouch about this.
No, I'm more into the business side of things.
I'm not really a technical expert.

Anyone who has tried what's in this bottle once would do anything at all to get some more of it.
任何尝过这瓶子里东西的人，只要尝过一次，都会不择手段地想要再尝到更多。
And I'm the only person in the world who knows how to make it.
而且我是世界上唯一一个知道如何制作它的人。
I think I'll charge a million dollars a gram for it, and then the price will go up and up.
我想我会以每克一百万美元的价格出售，然后价格会不断攀升。
charge: 收(费)

30 seconds to total destruction.
I'd better get out of here!
If I were you I'd just run!
Get down!
趴下,蹲下

The explosion did you job for you.
爆炸帮你完成了任务。
I wouldn't say that exactly.
我并不完全这么认为。
Let's just say that it helped me to do my job.
这么说吧，它确实帮了我完成工作。
When you tole me what happened to Roger, I just didn't care anymore.
当你告诉我罗杰发生的事时，我已经不再关心了。
Remember how I used to feel about him? It all seems such a long time ago, all that unhappiness!
还记得我以前对他的感觉吗？那些不愉快的事情似乎都已经过去很久了！
“all that unhappiness” 是同位语，用于补充说明 “it all” 的具体内容，即 “曾经的那些不愉快”
What did I think I was doing when I married him?
我当时在想什么啊，竟然嫁给了他？


They need to set up the equipment for the concert.
John finds a socket for the plug.
He plugs in the equipment.
他给设备插上电源。
plug in: 给…接通（电源）
John pulls the biggest switch.
约翰拉下了最大的开关。

This evening's broadcasting ends with a song by Toni Moroni.
Are you going to the Nervous Equipment concert next week?
The concert takes place in Madison Square Garden.
The concert's going to be late, they haven't set up the equipment yet.
When we did the sound check we found some problems with some of the instruments.

When the children have eaten their dinner, they should go to the bed.
When you try the food in this restaurant, you'll want to come here every day.
When you learn how to speak English better, you'll be able to look for a job in London.
When I start to sell this stuff, I'll be able to charge a lot of money for it.
When you've finished reading this book, can you give it back to me?

I thought you were an expert, but you don't seem to know very much about this.
They're not all the same size. That one over there seems to be the biggest one.
It was terrible accident. There only seem to be two survivors.
Mr. Berry has been taken to prison. He seems to have caused the explosion.
Where is everyone? There doesn't seem to be anybody around.
This room't like something out of a movie. It seems to be full of computers.
这个房间就像电影里的场景一样。里面似乎摆满了电脑。


Don't ask stupid questions! You heard what I said!
How did Roger get in here! Get him out of here, immediately.
Tirty seconds to total destruction! I'd better get out of here!
He's got a gun! He's going to shoot! Get down!
There's the prisoner! He's trying to escape! Guards, get him!
I've got a gun, and I'm ready to use it! Stay where you are!(待在原地！)
