What has Annie decided? to change her life.
What do Annie's friends decide? not to let Hugo in.

Did they really think I was going to stay in the car?
I thought Mr. P. would try to kill me, the bastard!
I was just thinking, you see.
As you haven't got anywhere to stay.
I was wondering if you'd like to move into the apartment while I'm away.
Gee, I don't know how to thank you.
She just wanted to give me her new address, that's all.
I thought you said she was away on vacation.
“said she” 在口语中通常连读为 /sedʃi/
I'm going to find out what the hell she thinks she's doing!

I'd just like to move out one or two antiques and items of furniture.
Would you mind giving me a hand?
I'm always happy to help a friend.
You'll go back with him, won't you?

What are you doing sitting on the sidewalk?
They've thrown me out of my apartment!
If I had a job I'd have some money, and if I had some money I'd pay the rent, wouldn't I?
It would be a good idea if you got in touch with me.

Hello, Hugo, back from your vacation?
Someone's sent me a postcard from Trinidad!
"Having a great time in Trinidad, but Mr. P hasn't been very helpful so far."

He's certain to try and get her back.
他肯定会设法把她找回来。
You'll go back with him, won't you?
Let's take a vote on it, then.
Who's for keeping him out? One, two, three.
And who's against? Only Annie.
That's decided, by a majority of three to one.
You'll go back with him, won't you?
Back to a nice safe job as some rich bastard's secretary.
回到一份不错的安全工作，做某个有钱混蛋的秘书。

I can't leave my TV here.
What if someone stole it?
What if Annie comes around looking for you?
She's still away in Sweden, on cacation.

"Dear Daddy, I've finally decided to do the right thing, and to live the life that's right for me."
She's walked out!
Everything's going wrong!


Did Hugo really think Roger was dead?
Did they really think Roger was going to stay in the car?
I thought Mr.P would try to kill me.
I was wondering if you'd like to move into the aparment?
Did you believe that Annie was going to move to Sweden?
I was wondering if you would like to have dinner with me somethime?
We were going to Trinidad on holiday, but we changed our plans.
Hey! I thought that he was going to Australia!

If John had some money, he'd pay the rent.
If John had a job, he wouldn't be unemployed.
If Annie got in touch with Hugo, he'd know what she is doing.
If John had more friends, he wouldn't be so longly.
If you were here, we could go out for dinner.
I'd tell you if I saw him.
People could call John if he had a phone.
I'd go out with him if he asked me.


Back from your cacation, Hugo?
Having a great time in Trinidada.
Doing you shopping today, are you?
Hey, got any milk?
Writing a postcard?
See you later this evening!
Take care , okay?
Love you, honey!
See what I mean?

I want to live the life that's right for me.
I'll never go back to that way of life!
我再也不会回到那种生活方式了！

He's certain to try to get in touch with me.
You have to arrive on time every day at work.
I look forward to having dinner with you tomorrow.
Been working hard?
You must get in touch with her immediately!
I was wondering if you'd like to help me carry some boxes.
I can't help you right now. I've got to take out the trash.
“I've got to” 翻译为 “我必须”，更口语化， 与 “I have to” 语义完全相同
I don't want to go to a movie tonight.
I feel like calling my mother.
Raising children is a hard job.
