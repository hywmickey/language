What is Kristi's apartment like? It's dirty and almost completely unfurnished.
Where is John? in the apartment next door.
How does Kristi know John? They went out on a date.
他们出去约会了。
Why do the two big guys attack Marco? They think he's Hugo Peters.
What reason does Hugo give Mr. P for not being at home? He doesn't want Mr. P's men to find him.
What does Mr. P think has happened to Roger Petri? He thinks Petri is dead.
What does Hugo offer to get for Mr. P? drugs.

I don't cook that often, but I am quite good at it.
I am sure it's the only thing you are good at.
Perhaps we should sit somewhere more comfortable...

The place is completely empty apart from this table and chairs.
It is a strange apartment, with this dark brown ceiling and light brown walls.
The place looks like it was last cleaned about 20 years ago.
Whoever lived here before was a total pig!
Sounds like there's someone knocking on your door.

I wasn't expecting___ anyone.
I thought I'd come and pick up my magazines.
Hey, what do you know, it's Kristi!
嘿，你猜怎么着！是克丽丝蒂！

Stay away from me.
Please don't hurt me!
You can have my watch.
Help! Put me down!
Very clever of you, Peters.
But your "visitors" will find you in the end.
Very well, I'll accept your offer.
But this stuff had better be really good... or else!
但这些东西最好真的很好……否则就惨了！

Whatever it is you've come to get, could you take it and go, please?
不管你来拿什么，能不能拿了东西就走？
Those gross magazines are yours, are they?
那些低俗杂志是你的，是吗？
I almost threw them in the trash this morning.
They're over there, in that wardrobe.

You can have my watch.
It was given to me by my grandfather.
This used to be my apartment, unitl I was thrown out for not paying the rent.

The Boss didn't say anything about a woman, he just said we should get rid of Hugo Peters.
Hugo used to live next door.

Could I have a word with the Boss, please?
Hold on.
What a pleasant surprise!
I'd like you to give me another chance.
我希望你再给我一次机会。
Give me one good reason why I should.


This place is so dirty. It looks like it was last cleaned about 20 years ago.
You look like you didn't sleep at all last night. Are you OK?
Something's not right. It feels like something terrible is going to happen.
Do you hear that music? It sounds like there's a party next door.
See how dark the sky is? Looks like it's going to rain.
It's so hot for March. It feels like summer already.
Listen to Olivia shouting. It sounds like she's really mad.

Whoever has moved into my old apartment can give me the magazines I left there.
I'm not going to go out on a date with you again, whatever you say to try and persuade me.
Whoever it is knocking on the door, tell them to go away. I don't want to see anyone right now.
If you you're hungry, please help yourself to whatever you want from the fridge.

The place is completely empty apart from this table and chairs, and the bed ...
It is a strange apartment, I must say, with this dark brown ceiling and these light brown walls.
Where's that music coming from? Gee, it's next door!
Your magazines are in that wardrobe. Take them away, please!

The apartment was cleaned about 20 years ago.
It was given to me by my grandfather.
I was thrown out for not paying the rent.
He was invited to the party by Hugo.
They were attacked by two men with guns.
We were told to arrive on time.

Who on earth is that?
Oh my God, it's you!
Hey, what do you know, it's Kristi!
Peters, it's you. What a pleasant surprise!
Mary, what a nice surprise!

Open up! We know you're there!
开门！我们知道你在里面！
There he is! Let's get him!
Put me down!
Please don't hurt me!
Stay away from me!
You can have my watch, just don't do anything to me!
你拿我的手表吧，只求别伤害我！
If they really want to find you, they will in the end.
要是他们真的想找你，最终总会找到你的。
You'd better bring me the money tomorrow, or else!

Apartment 3C, 724 West End Avenue February 11th
Dear Mom,
I thought I'd just write you a letter to tell you how I'm doing, as it's quite a long time since I last saw you.
As you can see, I've moved, but only to the next apartment. I decided to leave my old apartment. It was really getting much too small for me, and I'm staying here for the moment while I'm looking for anther one.
Do you remember Mr. Peters, that real nice and polite old guy who used to live next door to me? Well, he very kindly said I could stay in his apartment while he was away on business. Wasn't that nice of him?
Unfortunately, he took all his furniture away with him, and for some reason the phone doesn't work, either. Perhaps he forgot to pay the bill!
Now, about my work, I decided to leave that job with the oil company, and move into the music and entertainment business. I'm having a very interesting time, and what do you know? I saw Clive the other week!
I took one of my groups down to New Camford to play in his club. Everybody enjoyed themselves very much and asked us to come again.
Well, that's all for now. Look after yourself, Mom.
See you soon, All my love, John.

Whoever cleaned this room didn't do a very good job - it's very dirty still.
I was given some beautiful flowers by a group of students.
Using the internet used to be a lot slower before the technology improved.
How many books have you got there? It looks like you've been studying very hard!
I don't think I can save my marriage now, whatever I try to do.
Listen! It sounds like there's a train coming.
Did you use to have long hair, when you were a child!
My new car was made in Germany. German cars are the best!
It looks like it's going to be a beautiful day - there isn't a could in the sky.
I used to drink wine, but now I don't.

My old apartment was too small for me, so I moved out.
I was able to stay in a friend's apartment while she was away.
Someone's already moved into my old apartment.
The only problem is that the wardrobe is too small for me to put all my clothes in.
I hate cleaning, so I get someone to come in twice a week.
I decided to rent an apartment, I'm not ready to buy anywhere yet.
I painted the ceiling dark blue, and the walls light blue, so they go together.
Why's the phone bill so high this month? Who have you been calling?
Her apartment isn't very comfortable. There's not even a sofa to sit on!
Hi! I'm your new neighbor. I've just bought the house next door.
