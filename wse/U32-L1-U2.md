What about our equipment?
It's___ all been looked after, hasn't it?
All the equipment, and all your luggage have been send on.
Where are you going, if you don't mind me asking?
We're going to Trinidad for a music festival.

What kind of car would you like, sir?
Sedan or station wagon?
轿车还是客货两用车？
We have Nissans, VWs and Fords.
我们有日产、大众和福特。
Or would you prefer a Mercedes for a little extra luxury?
还是你更喜欢一辆梅赛德斯，以获得额外的奢华？
Any car will do, give me a Nissan sedan.
随便一辆车都行，给我一辆日产轿车。
Would you like your Nissan with or without a sunroof?
你想要有天窗的日产还是没有天窗的日产？
Would you like a two-door or a four-door model?
I don't care how many doors it's got!
I just want a car, with four wheels, that goes!
我只想要一辆车，带四个轮子，能开就行！
As soon as possible, OK?

Will you be paying by credit card?
关键语法点：将来进行时（Will be doing）的用法
此处不用简单的 “Will you pay...（一般将来时）”，而是用将来进行时，核心目的是弱化 “询问” 的压迫感，增强礼貌性。传递 “只是确认一下，不打扰你做决定” 的委婉态度。
I'll just go and process this card, sir.
Won't be a moment!
马上就好！

I don't want to become a member of any club.
I don't want anything, except a car.
Can I just pay for it and take it away, please?


I'm sorry about what happened that evening we went to Syracuse.
It wouldn't happen if we went there again, would it?
They'd listen to us this time, wouldn't they?
Not that I'd want to go there again, of course.

It's a radio! I wonder if it's got any batteries in it?
and this weeks number one, all aross the nation, is Nervous Equipment, with "Suicide Jive."
本周全美范围内的冠军，是 Nervous Equipment，他们凭借歌曲《Suicide Jive》登顶。
Can I come too?
It doesn't make any difference to me.

We have now reached our maximum cruising height of 10,000 meters.
That's way high, isn't it?
Let me just work it out.
让我来算一下。
It's about 15,000 miles. 

I've just been given this new phone.
It hasn't got a keyboard, or any keys.
You just touch the screen with this pen-type thing.
你只要用这支笔状的东西触碰屏幕就可以了。
Every time you touch the screen it makes a little sound.
You can even watch movies on it!

Would you mind not smoking, please?
Relax, you are making mi__ nervous!
You don't mind if this gentleman sits here, do you, Wart?
你不介意这位先生坐这儿吧，沃特（狗名）？


Everything has been looked after.
All the equipment and luggage have been send on.
Look, I've just been given a new phone.
It hasn't been used yet, it's still in its box.
All our cars have been rented out, we don't have any left.
Your luggage has already been packed.
We can't go, the bill hasn't been paid yet.

I'm sorry about what happend that night we went out to dinner at Renzo's.
It wouldn't happen if we went there again, would it?
They'd serve us the right dishes this time, wouldn't they?
And they wouldn't make us pay for the wrong dishes, either.
Well, not that I'd want to go back there anyway.
not that: 并不是说，并非
But, if we went, the service would probably be better.

The plan has now reached its maximum cruising height.
That plane is flying very high, isn't it?
The cruising altitude is 10,000 meters.
巡航高度为10,000米。
Ten thousand meters is 6.5 miles.
We bought a few pounds of apples.
There are two liters of soda in this bottle.
I had to put in 20 gallons of gas.

I wonder if the radio has any batteries in it.
It hasn't got a keyborad or any keys.
Every time you touch the screen it makes a little sound.
You don't touch it with your fingers. You use this pen-type thing.
You can even watch movies on it.
I've just been given this new phone.

I'll have a sedan.
two door will be fine, thanks.
I think I'll choose the second one.
I'm not sure, let's say four days.

We wouldn't fail if we studied, would we?
They'd listen to their teachers next time, wouldn't they?
Not that I'd want to go there again, but if I did, I'd visit more museums.
The rooms have all been cleaned, haven't they?
All the books have been returned to the library.
I've just been given this new hat by a friend.
You just touch the screen with this, like, pen-type thing.
Will you be paying by credit card?
He wouldn't be late if he watched the clock.
I've just been told I can go to school in the United States.
