Where is Lara? at a police station.
Who is the first to help? the police.
Why do the police sometimes have trouble understanding the people? The people have different backgrounds.
What does the police officer say that makes the problems with criminals worse? money problems.
What would make the police not able to do their jobs? worring about their safety.
How do Americans feel about safety now? They feel safer than before.

Tell me what trends in crimes you're seeing in America, in general?
When you have tough times, people need money for whatever reason, and crime goes up.
We have shoplifting, we have burglaries.
Is seems that everyday we see some new way to steal something from someboday or to con them.

I'm at a police station talking to officers about a typical day's work, and about crime and crim prevention in this suburban neighborhood.
我现在在警察局，正和警员们聊他们日常的工作，还有这个郊区社区里的犯罪情况以及犯罪预防（工作）。
Every day is different.
So there's a bit of a challenge in that.
Every single day you show up you don't know what's going to happen.
你出现的每一天，你都不知道会发生什么。
It's a very diverse community that we live in.
我们生活在一个非常多样化的社区。
It's hard for us to communicate, not understanding people's backgrounds and beliefs.

A police officer has the responsibility of being out making sure that everybody's safe.
We're first responder.
We're the first ones to come to any major or minor incident.
无论是大事还是小事，我们都是第一个赶到现场的。
We're the first people to respond, often before the ambulance or the fire department shows up, because we're already on the road.
我们是第一个响应的，往往在救护车或消防部门赶到之前就到了，因为我们本来就在巡逻途中。
“already on the road” 没有直译为 “已经在路上”，而是结合警察工作特点译为 “本来就在巡逻途中”，补充 “巡逻” 一词，让 “提前到达” 的原因更合理，符合语境逻辑。

Do you worry about your personal safety while you're on duty?
Are there precautions that you all take?
你们都采取了预防措施吗？
Obviously, you're very well-trained, but is that a concern?
显然，你训练有素，但这是一个问题吗。
It's always in the back of our minds, absolutely.
这事儿我们心里一直记着，绝对的。
But if we had in the forefront of our minds, I don't think we'd be able to do our job.
但要是我们总把这事放在心上（或 “挂在嘴边”），我觉得我们就没法正常工作了。
When you get a call you think on the way there,  wait a minute, this could be dangerous.
接到电话后，你在赶过去的路上会琢磨：“等等，这事可能有危险。”
But when you get there you just react, your adrenalin takes over.
但等你到了那儿，就只剩本能反应了 —— 肾上腺素会完全掌控你。
If anybody tells you they're not scared once in a while, either they're lying or they're crazy.
如果有人告诉你他们偶尔不会害怕，那要么他们在撒谎，要么他们疯了。
once in a while: 偶尔，有时

But our families are very proud of us, which makes us want to keep doing this.
Is this a satisfying job?
这是一份令人满意的工作吗？
Is it a job that you're proud to do?
It's a thankless job in a way.
从某种角度来说，这是份吃力不讨好的工作。
in a way : 从某种角度来说
thankless job: 吃力不讨好的工作
I think that Americans feel safer today than in the past.
Sometimes the police are portrayed in a negative way.
有时候警方会被以负面形象呈现。
portray: 描绘；表现
But for the most part there are a lot of good people trying really hard.
但大多数情况下，还是有很多好人在拼尽全力做事。
for the most part：大多数情况下
And I really do think that the community sees this.
而且我真的觉得，社区里的人是能看到这一点的。
So the officers in this area feel that their jobs can be very satisfying and rewarding.
因此，该地区的警察们觉得他们的工作非常令人满意且富有成就感。



Graffiti is a minor incident of crime.
Shoplifting is a crime that we see from big shopping malls to small clothing stores, and even supermarket.
When people are on vacation, the number of burglaries in homes and apartments increases.
It seams that everyday we see some new way to steal something from somebody.
People come up with new ways to con other people.
come up with: 想出

These police work in a suburban neighborhood.
Because of the difference, it can be a bit of a challenge.
We don't always understand people's backgrounds.
Not understanding people's beliefs makes it hard to communicate.

POLICE OFFICERS ARE ALWAYS ON THE JOB
Over the years, I've come to know some police officers well enough to realize that when their shift is over and they leave the problems of police work behind, a while new set of problems kicks in. Recently, Officer Jim Smith agreed to talk to me about the off-duty life of officers. He did so with the blessing of the police chief's office.
Nerve a break:
Smith finds there is never a time when he is not a police officer. His neighbors know he is a policeman. The fact that he is one in abother community makes no difference to them when things get sticky in the neighborhood.
"They may have a problem in which they need to call the police, but they'll call me instead."
In a sense, Smith is always working even when off duty.
"You see things that civlians don't see. I'll be driving with my wife and say,'There's a drug deal going down.' There's nothing I can do about it. I could call it in, but they'll be gone in 15 seconds."
Off duty, his service revolver also poses problems. There is no such thing as hiding it from his three children.
"We have to teach our kids about guns. Eventually, they're going to see it.(Maybe) the kid is just hugging you, and he sees the gun in your jacket."
On a family outing once, one of Smith's children noticed a man wearing a kind of purse around his waist. The child went up to the man and said: "Do you have a gun in there? My daddy has a gun."
Smith later told the boy, "You can't tell strangers I have a gun or that Daddy is a police officer."
Same old story:
Most people find it a novety to have a friend who is a police officer, They are apt to introduce him not as Jim Smith, but as "My friend, Jim He's a cop."
"What follows can be unpleasant for the officer." Says Smith. "Inevitably, you're going to hear about every rude cop they ever met and every ticket they got that wasn't deserved. Then comes the usual question: "Have you ever shot anybody?"
A different life:
The off-day problems of police could fill a page of this newspaper. Officers will be called to court on days off, only to arrive there and find they are not needed. Their spouses are alone much of the time. Of his wife, Smith says, "She is basically a single mother of three children four nights a week."
Once, in a gathering of six officers, they counted nine divorces among them. "The group include me, and I've never been divorced," says Smith.
Yet for all the problems of being an officer on duty and off Smith considers himself a lucky man. "It's the greatest job in the world," he says. "I wouldn't trade it for anything."

Jim Smith is talking about the problems of off-duty police officers.
Smith is a police officer in a different community from where he lives.
Smith can't always do anything about crimes he sees.
Because he has children, Smith has to be careful with his gun.
Smith doesn't want everyone to know he is a police officer. 
People find it interesting to have a friend who is a police officer.
When Smith meets new people, they often complain about other police officers.
Police officers often have problems with their marriages.

sure, that'll be fine.
No, I can't say I worry about that too much.
For the most part yes _____
Well I think sadly it's getting a little worse.
They work very hard.
I think I do sometimes.

The officer will talk about crime and crime prevention.
Police are the first people to respond to a call for help.
