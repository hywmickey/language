Why is Henson having trouble describing the man with Annie? He's too far.
Why are the other drives angry with Henson? He's driving the wrong way.
What does Henson say Annie and David are doing? talking about a letter.
Who is the letter from? David and Annie's father.
Why doesn't David want contact with his father? He is afraid his wife will get angry.
What does the taxi driver think that Bedges wants? That he wants to check the driver's documents.
What difficulty does Annie have in organizing her trip to Albania? There aren't many cheap choices.
Why does Annie go out another door? She wants to get away from Bedges.

I'm unable to tell you his name, I'm afraid.

Maybe he wasn't able to get in touch before now.
I am afraid I haven't been able to follow her.

Well, what does he look like?
Caucasian, black or ation__?
Tall or short?
Fair or dorkair__?
Caucasian, tall with fair hair.
高加索人，高个子，金发。
Has he got a small mustache?
他有小胡子吗？
That would be her borther David. I thought so.

They're discussing something, I'd say.

That young lady, with blonde hair and the shoulder bag.

I thought you were supposed to be following them!
Yeah, but unfortunately the street is one way westbound，and they are walking eastwards.
I'm unable to read it from here, without driving on to the sidewalk.
The sidewalk's very narrow.
Not nearly wide enough for a big car like this.
She's gone down the one way street.

You just go out through the office, and then run__to__us.

And there wouldn't be much point__, would there?
There must be some ware__ getting there without spending a fortune!

There are only going to be about ten or twelve of us, 
so there's not point to runting a forty__ siter__ bus

and they are now both walking toward Central Park.

so, there aren't any cheep flight to Tirana?
No, there aren't any low-cost airlines on that destination.
You best option would be to go from Frankfurt, Germany on Lufthansa.
你最好的选择是从德国法兰克福乘坐汉莎航空。
the fair is $428 one way, $810 return.
puls the fair___ from new york to Frankfurt.
Is that coach or business class?
Coach, of course.
Business class is much more than that.
That's really expensive, are there any reductions?
There's a 2.5% reduction for senior citizens.
老年人减少2.5%。
2.5%: two and a half percent.

I don't think there's any international rail service into Albania.
You could get a train as far as Podgorica_sir_ into  , Montenegro.
That's the nearest palce which can be reached by rail.
All I can suggest, is the you fight somewhere like ofen___ to unia
and then run to us.
How much would that cost?


I'm afraid I am unable to understand you.
He is not able to write it without help.
I'm afraid I can't help you with your work right now.
Maybe he wasn't able to meet her.
He is afraid he won't be able to read it all.
Why is he so afraid he won't be able to do it without me?

To go from New York to San Francisco you need to take the westbound bus.
Obviously, from San Francisco to New York, you go eastwards.
Just walk on the sidewalk; don't step into the street.
You can't turn around here; this is a one-way street.
This rolad leads straight to the airport; just keep going.
This street isn't wide enough for two cars to pass each other.
Walk toward the train station, then make a right just before you get there.

Athens has been the capital of Greece for over 2000 years.
Munich and Frankfurt are in Germany.
Podgorica is in Montenegro.
Tirana is in Albania.
Central Park is in New York.
The Philippines are make up of many islands.
Shanghai is in China.
Tokyo is in Japan.

How much is the fare to Europe?
Are you looking for a one-way ticket or return ticket?
If you go by land, take the train. However, if you go by water, go by ferry.
I might need to change money; where can I change foreign currency?
You can rent a bus or car.
Do you want to travel business class or coach?
When you cross the borther, you will need to show your passport.
I don't want to stop on my way to Frankfurt, so are there any direct flights?
What means of transportation should we use to get there?
Are there any fare reductions for students?

It is too high up. I'm unable to reach it.
它太高了。我够不着。
high up: 高处
Watched by her mother, the little girl went outside to play.
What do you mean you lost the money? I thought you were supposed to be be watching it!
After hours of work, I'm on the point of finishing the job.
There must be some way of making them listen to us.
He looks very happy. He may have heard some good news about that job.
Are all of you planning on going? No, only three of us are actually going.
We'll be taking a very small plane; it's just a 2 seater.
我们将乘坐一架非常小的飞机；这只是一辆2座的车。
He can cook really well without even trying.
他甚至不用努力就能做得很好。
He's not nearly old enough to drive.
他还没到开车的年龄。

| How are we going to be able to sleep in a mini-bus?          | You could rent a camper instead; that might be more comfortable. |
