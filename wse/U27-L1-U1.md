The Universe Hotel Port of Spain Trinidad West Indies 
Dear Dad,
This is just to say that Juanita and I are having a marvelous honeymoon there on Trinidad.
There's a lovely beach right next to the totel. The food is excellent, and the cocktails are even better! The weather has been absolutely great, of course, and I've gotten quite brown.
I'm not sure what we'll do next. Juanita wants to go straight back to New York, so that I don't lose my job, but I think that's ridiculous.
I mean, after all, she has only to say the word to her father, and we'll have no more money problems. The trouble is, Juanita isn't always the most reasonable person in the world, and neither is her father. I'll have to play it very carefully, I think.
By the way, a very funny thing happened this morning.
Juanita and I were down by the sea. I was enjoyed a cocktail, and Juanita was reading some stupid novel, when this strange guy came up to us and ask us some questions about you.
He was wearing a white suit, black tie, and size 12 shoes. Juanita thought he was a cop. The thing is, he had a photo of you, and he said he was a friend of yours.
Of course, I won't say anything about it, but if you happen to see Mr.Ramires, do put in a good word for me, won't you?
Much love, David.

I'm slowing down to let that guy pass.
Are you trying to be funny, Hugo?
你想搞笑吗，雨果？
You don't dare to tell Mr.P about this!
Let's stop palying games.
My advice to you is to go back to the airport.
I enjoy reading on the beach.
Swiming is good exercise.

There's a lovely beach right next to the hotel.
We go swimming in the sea very day.
Juanita and I are having a marvelous honeymoon here on Trinidad.
I am checking in for the flight to Sydney.
Which gate is the flight leaving from?
The plane took off ten minutes ago.
Was Mr.Bruce Cobber on the 19:25 flight to Sydney?
He definitely checked in for the flight!
Could I have a single ticket to New York, please?
I'd like to sit in first class.
The hotel is great. It has a fantastic view of the whole island.
