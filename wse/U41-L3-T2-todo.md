SLOW FOOD

Italy has long been known for its culinary masterpieces, and its influence worldwide is strong. However, a rather than movement has been putting Italian food, beverages, and cuisine in a completely unexpected spotlight. Long before the idea of fast food was conceptualized, Italians hand molded cheese, grew their crops with care, and enjoyed life with a glass of wine or a cup of coffee. This Italian tradition of pride in its cuisine and enjoyment of life is what the new movement is all about. It is called the Slow Food Movement, and it was founded by leftist Italian journalist Carlo Petrini in the small Italian town of Bra. This grass-roots movement now has over 66,000 members all around the world and is gaining in popularity as people come to apperciate its commitment to maintaining and supporting traditional methods of growing, producing and preparing food.

With the rise in fast food restaurants putting traditional foods in danger, the Slow Food Movement was born in the late 1980s. Its belief is that slow enjoyment is the only way to confront the global stupidity of fast life. The symbol of the Slow Food Movement is the snail, which definitely encompasses the philosophy of the movement. It doesn't believe in fast food, it doesn't believe in mass production of food, and it certainly doesn't believe in any type of global commercialization of fast food. The Slow Food Movement promotes good, clean, and fair food. This means that food should taste good, be free of pesticides and dangerous chemicals, and that the farmers and people who produce the food and beverages should be paid a fair compensation for their products.

Prior to the Slow-Food Movement, many specialty food items that could only be found in specific areas in Italy were endangered as many small-time farmers could not compete with the big commerical food industry. They had hung up their hoes in the face of the changing world of food production. But thanks to the Slow Food Movement, certain foods, such as Albenga's purple asparagus, Tevi's black celery, and Vesuvio's apricot have made a comeback. The Slow Food Movement has also helped to protect Laticauda's long-tailed sheep, Siena' s pig-renowned since medieval times-and countless other products such as cheeses, salamis, and wines.

Slow Food does not want us to become a world where children think of meal time as eating food from cans, plastic containers, and boxer. It wants children to appreciate whole grain goodness, fruits and vegetables, and homemade food. food is a national pastime in Italy, where thanks to Petrini and his group it might continue to be.Rather than being frightened of fast food corporations, the Italian-born movement feels that it can fight them and beat them. Petrini has bet on the quality of products rather than on the quantity. Petrini has said that if we are to be responsible for what we eat, then we, the consumers, have to be the "co-creators" of our food. That means, according to Petrini, that we have to want to eat healthy organic food with high-quality ingredients so that farmers know they will have a market for growing such crops.

However, Slow Food is not just a movement for those few organic nuts. It actually has quite a bit of political clout as well. It showed its power when the European Union attempted to enforce uniformly strict hygiene standards for all European food producers. The Slow Food Movement realized that these standards would have made it impossible for thousands of small farmers because they would have had to create extensive reports and piles of paperwork and purchase new equipment which would drive them out of business. Slow Food stepped in with a petition that was signed by more than 500,000 people, and this resulted in Italy obtaining exemptions from the EU for thousands of skillful creators of food products.

The question which now remains is if it is possible for Slow Food to become a mass movement that can reach beyond a minority of concerned consumers. There are several reasons to support the likelihood of Slow Food becoming a mass movement. When the movement first started, it focused its efforts on preserving Itaian wine and food. However, as the movement has grown, it has also taken other countries's products under its wings. Other examples of foods that the Slow Food Movement has protected or saved are Clifornia's Sun Crest Peach, Nova Scotia s red fife wheat, and Japan's kyo-ninjin. Additionally, according to a Slow Food survey, a large portion of Italians say they would pay up to 20 percent more for food if it would guarantee the quality of the food. So perhaps there is a growing demandfor a return to the traditional, to a slower life, and to healthier, more quality food.
