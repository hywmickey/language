SALESMAN PERFORMANCE REPORT NAME OF SALESMAN: John Aloysius Berry.
Dear Colleagues,
Although this salesman has only been working with thie organization for two weeks, it is already quite possible to give a general picture of his success in selling, and his value to the organization.
As far as his success in selling is concerned, the fact that in two weeks he has not sold anything at all I think says quite enough.
As for his value to the organization, I would describe it as less than nothing, indeed, even less than that.
I have asked Mr. Berry to leave his position and to return to us thie five Laundroperk machines which he has been unsuccessfully carrying around the streets of Brooklyn, as from next Monday.
我已要求贝里先生离职，并自下周一起，归还我们那五台他一直拖着在布鲁克林街头推销却毫无成效的 Laundroperk 洗衣机。
Needless to say, I will be keeping the deposit of $500 which Mr. Berry paid for these machines, tough I will wait for him to return them before informing him.
不用说，我会保留贝里先生为这些机器支付的500美元押金，不过我会等他归还机器后再通知他。
Signed October 26tyh, Eamonnn T. Conn

She's a psychiatrist, but she works from home. She has a consulting room in her house.
她是一名精神病学家，但她在家工作。她家有一间咨询室。
Hi! Nice to see you! You can hang up your coat in the hall.
I don't want a furnished apartment because I already have a bed, table, chairs, and everything I need.
This apartment is unfurnished. You'll need to bring your own furniture.
How many inhabitants are there in your city? Oh, I'd say about 4 million.
I can't afford to buy an apartment, but I hate having to pay rent.
I'd have to pay $2,000 a month for my apartment, but luckily, I share it with my friend.
I need the key to unlock the door.
The rent is $900 a month, but you'll have to pay a deposit of $500 before you move in.
After the party, we had a lot of garbage to throw out.
