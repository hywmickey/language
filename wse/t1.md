Gee, that nearly killed me!
I guess I should have left the boxes at the bottom.

If it's the rent, I'll be paying__ it tomorrow.
It's nothing to do with the rent.

I seem to __have lost my bit of paper.
Guess I should have put it in my pants pocket.
I was just wondering if you had a washing machine.

Real nice to have met you!
You'd better not come back!
I'd better get out of this place as fast as I can!
I've got my questionnaire, I'm ready to go!

I think you'd better come in.
Well, take your coat off.
You can hang it up here on the hall.

I think I'll be going now.

What are load of garbage___!
You will meet a smart, beautiful young woman, in my dreams!
Oh well, I'd better get on with it.

I shouldn't have given her all that money.


Are you the only person in this house?
No, I share it with three other people.
What's it to do with you?
Is the house owned or rented? And if rented, is it furnished or unfurnished?
We rent it, unfurnished.

Do you remember the goold old days, when Hugo and I were neighbors?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have mentioned Hugo.
I shouldn't have tried to sell her a machine.
I should just have asked her out to dinner.

Your hair's different, your coat's different. 
I'm here to demonstrate this amazing new machine which makes clothes and washes coffee.

Get in the car please.
What for? What about my boxes?
You won't be needing them.


John sells machines which wash clothes.
A coffee machine makes coffee.
When John enters Madam Olga's apartment, he takes off his coat.
Madam Olga tells him go hang his coat up in the hall.
I have to clean the filthy floor.
Why are you wearing a suit and tie?
I thought I put the key in my coat pocket.
My feet are cold; I need a warm pair of socks.

I pay $700 a month rent.
If I had a washing machine, I wouldn't have to go to the laundromat.
Do you live alone, or do you share this apartment with other people?
Do you own the house or rented it?
Is the apartment furnished or unfurnished?
I can't open the door. I need a key to unlock it.
We'll have to pay a $500 deposit before you can move into the apartment.

He's realy angry. I'd better get out of this place.
If you want me to go away, you'd better pay me.
It's cold outside; you'd better come in.
If you don't want the police to arrest you, you had better not commit any crimes.
I'd better get that. I've been expecting his call.
我最好去接一下。我一直在等他的电话。
John had better sell some machine, or he won't have a job.
Mr. Jacobs had better learn English if he wants to work in an international company.
