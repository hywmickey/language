I felt that letter on the table on purpose; I wanted you to see it.

SALESMAN PERFORMANCE REPORT NAME OF SALESMAN: John Aloysius Berry.
Dear Colleagues,
Although this salesman has only been working with thie organization for two weeks, it is already quite possible to give a general picture of his success in selling, and his value to the organization.
As far as his success in selling is concerned, the fact that in two weeks he has not sold anything at all I think says quite enough.
As for his value to the organization, I would describe it as less than nothing, indeed, even less than that.
I have asked Mr. Berry to leave his position and to return to us thie five Laundroperk machines which he has been unsuccessfully carrying around the streets of Brooklyn, as from next Monday.
我已要求贝里先生离职，并自下周一起，归还我们那五台他一直拖着在布鲁克林街头推销却毫无成效的 Laundroperk 洗衣机。
Needless to say, I will be keeping the deposit of $500 which Mr. Berry paid for these machines, tough I will wait for him to return them before informing him.
不用说，我会保留贝里先生为这些机器支付的500美元押金，不过我会等他归还机器后再通知他。
Signed October 26tyh, Eamonnn T. Conn

She's a psychiatrist, but she works from home. She has a consulting room in her house.
她是一名精神病学家，但她在家工作。她家有一间咨询室。
Hi! Nice to see you! You can hang up your coat in the hall.
I don't want a furnished apartment because I already have a bed, table, chairs, and everything I need.
This apartment is unfurnished. You'll need to bring your own furniture.
How many inhabitants are there in your city? Oh, I'd say about 4 million.
I can't afford to buy an apartment, but I hate having to pay rent.
I'd have to pay $2,000 a month for my apartment, but luckily, I share it with my friend.
I need the key to unlock the door.
The rent is $900 a month, but you'll have to pay a deposit of $500 before you move in.
After the party, we had a lot of garbage to throw out.

Can you tell her to call me on my cell phone as soon as possible?
I'll be in New York for the rest of this week.

Is central heating still not working?
You mean, haven't I repaired it yet?
I just can't figure out what's wrong?
You know what New York plumbers are like.
你知道纽约的水暖工是什么样子的。
We're supposed to be autonomous and self-sufficient.
我们理应做到自主独立且自给自足。
We'll have to get someone in to fix it.
We should be able to deal with this small mechanical problems.

Becuase I'm the only one here with any mechanical skills, and, as I already said, I can't deal with this problem.
I hope the fridge's working at least.
And I mended the freezer too. 

It might have been something to do with the demonstration against that pharmaceutical company.
这可能与那场反对那家制药公司的示威活动有关。

That's all very well in theory
理论上这一切都很好（但实际未必可行）。
But it doesn't working in practice, does it?

We freeze to death, unitl we can find someone who'll fix it for free?

If I known how ro repair it, I would have repaired it.
Is she been__ a cop, she just__ rung off when I answered.
She wouldn't have left her phone number, she'd have called back later.
If it had been anything really serious, the Germans would have contacted me directly.

与此同时，纽约警察局正在调查一种说法 —— 某个当地组织可能协助实施了这起绑架案。
Mr. Lembach was kidnapped two days ago, apparently, by a group of evironmentalist terrorists.
显然，这是一群极端环保主义者所为。

I'd have gone to visit her if I'd known she was in the hospital.
If it had been serious, my mother would have called me on my cell phone.
If John hadn't goine through the red light, the police wouldn't have stopped him.
If we'd had time, we'd have cooked dinner.
What would Mary have said if she'd known I was in love with her boyfriend?

No one has been in touch with the President's office about it yet, apparently.
Most medicines are produced by Western pharmaceutical companies.
An autonomous, language user is someone who doesn't depend on dictionaries or translations.
一个独立的语言使用者是指不依赖词典或翻译的人。
If we grew out own fruit and vegetables we could be more or less self-sufficient.
如果我们自己种植水果和蔬菜，我们就能或多或少实现自给自足。
That's a very interesting theory, but how can you prove that it's true?

If you don't fix the heating, we are going to freeze to death.
I can't afford this; It's terribly expensive!
When I tell you hands off, I mean it, it's all mine.
I cannot wait to meet your mother; in fact, I am dying to meet her.
That book is so interesting that I can't stop reading it.


We sleep on a double bed.
Jamie has an electric cooker.
Her aparment is just a short walk away from the supermarket.
My new apartment is 100 square meters.
Her furniture is all leather.
I especially love her sofa because it is very soft.
We park our car in the garage.
It is so cold in here! Isn't the central heating working?
Help yourself to a drink. There's ice in the freezer.

If I'd have enough money, I might have rented that apartment.
The toilet works again; the plumber may already have fixed it.
Martin's very smart; he should be able to fix the problem.
The char is made of leather.
While we're on the subject of cops, didn't you get a speeding ticket yesterday?
既然我们谈到了警察，你昨天不是收到了一张超速罚单吗？
No one is believed to know the whereabouts of the missing industralist.
人们认为，无人知晓那位失踪实业家的下落。
Would you be so kind as to give her a message?
能否劳烦你给她捎个口信？
be so kind as to：固定表达，相当于 “劳烦、恳请”，是礼貌程度升级的核心。

Where did Liliane get her information about David's father? She heard about it.
What about Annie want when she calls? She wants to talk to David about something.
Why does Annie want to meet David at his apartment? because it is warmer than the park.
Why does Annie interrupt David when he is telling her his address? because she knows how to get there.
What does Annie do? She works for a magazine and holds meeting regarding environmental issues.
Why does Annie want to leave with David? She wants to talk to David alone.
Why does Juanita become angry? because Annie doesn't want to tell her anything.
What is David worried about? that Annie is involved with criminals.

It's all right. I'll get it!
No you won't; I'll get it!
Can I have a word with David?
What's it about?
It's nothing important.
Could I just speak to him, please?
Look David, I've got to talk to you urgently.
戴维，听着，我有急事要跟你说。
“I've got to” 是 “I have got to” 的缩写，口语中相当于 “I must”，意为 “必须、得”，比直译 “我已经要去” 更符合中文表达习惯，突出紧迫性。


What __ we met in the park?
Haven't you noticed, David, it's snowing!
I'd rather we met at your place.
I't 188 West 105th Street, and we're in the basement.
188: one eight eight
105th: one hundred fifth.
When you get to No. 188, go down the steps outside.
当你到达188号时，沿着外面的台阶走。
188: one eight eight

Is it true that David's father was a member of an international criminal gang, and that he was murdered by his boss?
I wouldn't have married Daivd if he'd been the son of a criminal.
How can you say such a thing?
你怎么能说出这种话？
I'm only repeating what I've heard.
This is my sister in law, Annie.
How lovely to meet you!
见到你真高兴。

I hear you're this wildly radical environmentalist.
我听说你是个激进的环保主义者。
wildly:非常,极其
radical:激进的,极端的
I guess you could say that.
How exciting!
好激动啊！
Do you go around blowing up nuclear power stations?
No, I had edited__ a magazine, 

Say hello to your aunt Annie.
I'd rather you didn't call me aunt.
What would you rather I called you, then - uncle?

Listen David, can we have a word - in private?
How mysterious! How embarrassing!
Look, this really isn't a great moment.
Unless it's really important we'd better leave it for now.
除非事情真的很重要，否则我们最好先放一放。
I wouldn't have come here if it hadn't been important, would I?
This is hopeless; we can't talk here.
这根本行不通，我们没法在这里谈。
We'll have to go to a coffee shop or something.

So what's all this about, then?
It's a private and personal matter, which doesn't concern you.
David happens to be my husband!
戴维恰好是我丈夫！
Therefore whatever concerns him also concerns me!
所以任何与他有关的事，也都与我有关！
Look, I don't want to argue with you.
You have no right to come here and behave like this!
She'll murder me when I get back!
You're so damn weak, David!
Why do you let her walk all over you?
为什么让她骑在你头上？

And as for all this business about the kidnapping - I just don't want anything to do with it.


If he had been poor, I never would have married him.
Would you have hired him if he had been rude during the interview?
I would have visited her at the hospital if I had known about her illness.
He wouldn't have said anything about it, would he?
If I had won a million dollars, I would have stopped working.
What would you have said if he had recognized you?
I would have quit my job if I had had to work so many hours.
He would have helped me if I had needed him to, wouldn't he?

Be careful with that man. He's known to be a member of a violent gang.
The police arrested him for murdering his wife.
He is a criminal because he stole a lot of money.
He is a radical politician; he has some crazy ideas about how to change the world.
The terrorists were responsible for the car explosion.
No one knows who kidnapped the child.
They used gas tanks to blow up the building.

The man rents an apartment at the bottom of the house in the basement.
When you get to the corner, you can wait for me.
Do you want to meet at my place or yours?
Just go down the steps.
I'll be waiting for you right outside in the garden.
Which street is the house on?

I really don't want to do this now unless it's really necessary.
If it's really urgent, I can speak now.
Can we please talk now, and in private?
The situation is looking hopeless; we must do something immediately.
I said it was important; otherwise I wouldn't have come here.
I wouldn't have bothered you if it hadn't been absolutely necessary.

I don't want to know anything about this situation. It really don't concern me.
This is a very personal matter; I don't want anyone else to know about it.
You have no right to call me in the middle of the night.
I really need some privacy.
I want to know what you are talking about because it just happens to include me!
It is really rude of her to to behave like that in my house.
He's so weak. He just lets his wife walk all over him.

jpeters@coolmail.com
It was amazing to see you again the other day, and to meet you lovely daughter and your handsome, clever husband.
I just wanted to tell you - the most extraordinary thing happened to me after I left you. I was stopped by this funny little man in a car, who asked me loads of questions about you and David and Annie.
I wouldn't have minded so much if he hadn't been so unattractive! Maybe I shouldn't have told him that David used to take drugs but I had to tell him something just to get rid of him. I'm sure you understand.
I don't want to frighten, darling, but I thought you really should see this terrible magazine article, so I scanned it for you.
Why did the daughter of Mexico's Mr.Big marry the son of an international drugs criminal, and brother of a well-know terrorist? And who really gave the order to kill New York businessman Hugo Peters?
These are some of the questions that top reporter Kristi Schmidt will be trying, to answer in her article in next month's Playperson.
People are saying such terrible things about you, you see. If I were you I'd be very careful.
extraordinary: 不寻常的
frighten: 吓唬
Playperson:《花花公子》

I won't go to his party if he doesn't invite me.
If he were to call me, I wouldn't answer the phone.
要是他真的给我打电话，我也不会接的
这句话的核心是对将来情况的虚拟语气，用于表达 “假设未来发生某件不太可能的事，会产生怎样的结果”。
“were to + 动词原形” 是对将来虚拟的固定结构。不管主语是第几人称，be 动词一律用 were，比普通过去时（If he called me）更强调 “事情发生的可能性极低”。
I'm sure he would have come if he had known you were here.
If I hadn't had to work last night, I would have helped you.
If he asks me anything about the situation, I won't tell him.
如果他问我关于这件事的任何情况，我都不会告诉他。
这句话的核心是真实条件句，用于表达 “对现在或将来可能发生的真实情况，会产生对应的明确结果”
“If he asks me...” 用 一般现在时（asks） 表示将来可能发生的条件。
真实条件句的从句不用过去时或特殊虚拟结构，直接用现在时表将来，强调 “事情有发生的可能性”。
“I won't tell him” 用 will + 动词原形（won't = will not） 表示在条件满足时，会出现的确定结果。
Be careful what you say in front of her. If she hears anything, she'll repeat it to anyone.
I would offer a drink if I had anything in the fridge.
要是我冰箱里有东西的话，我会给你倒杯饮料的。
这句话的核心是对现在事实相反的虚拟条件句，用于表达 “当前冰箱里没有东西，所以无法提供饮料” 的现实，同时假设 “有东西” 时的行为。
：“if I had anything in the fridge” 用 一般过去时（had） 表示与现在事实相反的假设。
实际情况是 “冰箱里没有东西”，虚拟语气中用过去时替代现在时，be 动词需用 were（此处 had 是实义动词 “有” 的过去式）。
“I would offer a drink” 用 would + 动词原形（offer） 表示假设条件满足时，会产生的结果。
would 此处表 “会、愿意”，是对现在虚拟主句的固定情态动词搭配，不能用 will。
If I were you, I would study a little harder.
If the bus had arrived on time, I might have gotten here earlier.
I would have bought you the sweater if I'd known your size.
I don't want to go if you're not going.
She would murder me if she knew I was talking to you.
要是她知道我在跟你说话，非气死 / 骂死我不可！
“if she knew I was talking to you” 是虚拟条件从句，核心符合 “一般过去时表与现在相反” 的规则。
“She would murder me” 用 “would + 动词原形（murder）”，是对现在虚拟主句的固定搭配。

英文对将来虚拟语气完整用法及场景示例清单
一、核心结构（从句+主句）
对将来虚拟语气有3种常用从句结构，主句形式固定，具体如下：

| 从句结构                | 主句结构                | 语气特点                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| If + 主语 + were to + 动词原形 | 主语 + would/should/could/might + 动词原形 | 可能性最低，强调“假设性极强” |
| If + 主语 + should + 动词原形  | 主语 + would/should/could/might + 动词原形 | 可能性较低，隐含“万一”的意味 |
| If + 主语 + 一般过去时（be动词用were） | 主语 + would/should/could/might + 动词原形 | 可能性中等，日常最常用       |

二、关键用法要点
1. 从句主语无论单复数，be动词一律用were，不能用was（如If I were you，而非If I was you）。
2. 主句的情态动词可根据语义选择：would表“会”，should表“应该”，could表“能够”，might表“可能”。
3. 可省略if，将were/should提到主语前（倒装结构），语气更正式（如Were he to come = If he were to come）。

三、场景示例（日常+商务+社交）
1. 日常沟通场景
- If she were to ask for help, I would definitely agree.（要是她真的求助，我肯定会答应。—— 暗示她大概率不会求助）
- If it should rain tomorrow, we might cancel the picnic.（万一明天下雨，我们可能会取消野餐。—— 担心小概率下雨事件）
- If I had more time, I would learn to play the guitar.（要是我有更多时间，我会学弹吉他。—— 假设当前时间不足的将来情况）

2. 商务沟通场景
- If the client were to reject the proposal, we should prepare a backup plan.（如果客户真的拒绝提案，我们应该准备备选方案。—— 预判低概率风险）
- If the project should be delayed, could we extend the deadline?（万一项目延期，我们能延长截止日期吗？—— 委婉询问应对方案）
- If we invested more in technology, we would improve efficiency.（要是我们在技术上多投入，就能提高效率。—— 假设未来投资决策）

3. 社交/情感场景
- If he should apologize, I might forgive him.（万一他道歉，我可能会原谅他。—— 对对方道歉的可能性持怀疑态度）
- If we were to travel abroad next year, which country would you choose?（要是明年我们出国旅行，你会选哪个国家？—— 纯粹假设，可能性较低）
- If the concert were to be canceled, many fans would be disappointed.（要是演唱会真的取消，很多粉丝会失望的。—— 预判极小概率的负面情况）

对现在虚拟条件句专项用法清单
一、核心结构（从句+主句）
对现在虚拟条件句的结构固定，核心是“从句用一般过去时，主句用 would/should/could/might + 动词原形”，具体如下：

- 从句：If + 主语 + 一般过去时（be动词一律用 were，无论主语单复数）
- 主句：主语 + would/should/could/might + 动词原形

二、关键用法要点
1. 本质是“与现在事实相反”，假设的条件当前并不成立，可能性为零。
2. be动词特殊规则：从句中主语是I/you/he/she/it/they时，均用 were，不能用 was。
3. 主句情态动词选择：would 表“会”，should 表“应该”（主语为第一人称时常用），could 表“能够”，might 表“可能”，可根据语义替换。
4. 实义动词变化：从句中实义动词用过去式（如 have → had，know → knew），主句保持动词原形。

三、场景示例（覆盖日常+社交+商务）
1. 日常场景（描述当前缺失的条件与对应结果）
- If I had more money, I would buy a new phone.（现在我没钱，要是有钱的话，我会买部新手机。）
- If she were here, we could play cards together.（她现在不在这儿，要是在的话，我们可以一起打牌。）
- If the weather were better, I might go for a walk.（现在天气不好，要是天气好的话，我可能会去散步。）

2. 社交场景（委婉表达意愿或遗憾）
- If I were you, I wouldn’t accept that invitation.（我不是你，要是我是你的话，我不会接受那个邀请。）
- If we had more time, we should have dinner together.（现在我们没时间，要是有时间的话，我们应该一起吃晚饭。）

3. 商务场景（假设当前条件，提出潜在行动）
- If our team had more resources, we could finish the task earlier.（现在团队资源不足，要是资源充足，我们能更早完成任务。）
- If the company offered flexible working hours, more employees would be satisfied.（现在公司没有弹性工作时间，要是有的话，更多员工会满意。）

四、与真实条件句（现在场景）对比
| 对比维度       | 对现在虚拟条件句                | 现在真实条件句                  |
|----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 结构           | 从句：一般过去时（be=were）；主句：would+动原 | 从句：一般现在时；主句：will+动原 |
| 核心语气       | 与现在事实相反，假设不成立      | 条件可能发生，符合当前现实      |
| 可能性         | 0%                              | 较高（有发生的合理概率）        |
| 例句           | If I knew his number, I would call him.（我现在不知道他的号码） | If I know his number, I will call him.（我可能知道他的号码） |

虚拟条件句中的夸张表达示例清单
一、核心特点
虚拟条件句中的夸张表达，本质是“对现在事实相反的假设”+“口语化夸张修辞”。夸张词并非字面含义，而是为了强化情绪（担忧、无奈、庆幸、不满等），让表达更生动自然，语法上仍严格遵循“从句一般过去时、主句 would+动词原形”的结构。

二、场景化示例（附含义解析）
1. 表达“担忧对方生气/反对”
- If my mom knew I skipped class, she’d kill me!  
  （字面：杀了我；实际：狠狠骂我/惩罚我 → 担忧妈妈得知逃课后的强烈反应）
- If he found out I lied, he’d go crazy.  
  （字面：发疯；实际：极度生气/抓狂 → 害怕对方发现谎言后的愤怒）
- If my boss knew I messed up the report, she’d fire me on the spot.  
  （字面：当场解雇我；实际：严厉批评我 → 夸张表达工作失误的严重后果）

2. 表达“无奈/遗憾（因当前条件不足）”
- If I could speak French fluently, I’d rule the world!  
  （字面：统治世界；实际：能轻松应对很多场景 → 夸张法语流利后的便利）
- If we had tickets to the concert, we’d be on top of the world.  
  （字面：站在世界之巅；实际：超级开心 → 遗憾没票，夸张有票后的喜悦）
- If I had that much free time, I’d travel to every corner of the globe.  
  （字面：环游地球每个角落；实际：去很多地方旅行 → 无奈当前时间有限）

3. 表达“庆幸（因假设的坏情况未发生）”
- If I’d forgotten her birthday, she’d never forgive me.  
  （字面：永远不原谅我；实际：长时间生气 → 庆幸自己没忘生日）
- If we’d taken that dangerous road, we’d be in big trouble.  
  （字面：陷入大麻烦；实际：遇到危险/麻烦事 → 庆幸选了安全路线）

4. 表达“调侃/轻微不满”
- If my roommate ate my snacks again, I’d throw his stuff out!  
  （字面：扔了他的东西；实际：严厉抗议 → 调侃室友偷吃零食的行为）
- If he kept talking nonsense, I’d walk out of the room.  
  （字面：走出房间；实际：不想再听 → 轻微不满对方说废话）

三、用法要点
1. 夸张词需贴合语境：常用 kill、go crazy、lose my mind、fire、never forgive 等，避免过度夸张导致语义模糊。
2. 语法不能脱节：无论夸张程度如何，从句仍用一般过去时（be动词用were），主句用 would+动词原形，不能混淆真实条件句结构。
3. 语气适配场景：日常沟通中使用，正式场合（如商务、学术）需避免，以免显得不庄重。

这份清单覆盖了虚拟条件句中最常用的夸张表达，每个例子都明确了字面与实际含义，方便你直接套用在口语交流中。要不要我帮你生成一份**配套翻译练习（含语法纠错提示）**，帮你巩固“虚拟结构+夸张表达”的结合用法？
