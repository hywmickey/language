I felt that letter on the table on purpose; I wanted you to see it.

SALESMAN PERFORMANCE REPORT NAME OF SALESMAN: John Aloysius Berry.
Dear Colleagues,
Although this salesman has only been working with thie organization for two weeks, it is already quite possible to give a general picture of his success in selling, and his value to the organization.
As far as his success in selling is concerned, the fact that in two weeks he has not sold anything at all I think says quite enough.
As for his value to the organization, I would describe it as less than nothing, indeed, even less than that.
I have asked Mr. Berry to leave his position and to return to us thie five Laundroperk machines which he has been unsuccessfully carrying around the streets of Brooklyn, as from next Monday.
我已要求贝里先生离职，并自下周一起，归还我们那五台他一直拖着在布鲁克林街头推销却毫无成效的 Laundroperk 洗衣机。
Needless to say, I will be keeping the deposit of $500 which Mr. Berry paid for these machines, tough I will wait for him to return them before informing him.
不用说，我会保留贝里先生为这些机器支付的500美元押金，不过我会等他归还机器后再通知他。
Signed October 26tyh, Eamonnn T. Conn

She's a psychiatrist, but she works from home. She has a consulting room in her house.
她是一名精神病学家，但她在家工作。她家有一间咨询室。
Hi! Nice to see you! You can hang up your coat in the hall.
I don't want a furnished apartment because I already have a bed, table, chairs, and everything I need.
This apartment is unfurnished. You'll need to bring your own furniture.
How many inhabitants are there in your city? Oh, I'd say about 4 million.
I can't afford to buy an apartment, but I hate having to pay rent.
I'd have to pay $2,000 a month for my apartment, but luckily, I share it with my friend.
I need the key to unlock the door.
The rent is $900 a month, but you'll have to pay a deposit of $500 before you move in.
After the party, we had a lot of garbage to throw out.

I'll be in New York for the rest of this week.

Is central heating still not working?
You mean, haven't I repaired it yet?
I just can't figure out what's wrong?
You know what New York plumbers are like.
你知道纽约的水暖工是什么样子的。
We're supposed to be autonomous and self-sufficient.
我们理应做到自主独立且自给自足。
We'll have to get someone in to fix it.
We should be able to deal with this small mechanical problems.

Becuase I'm the only one here with any mechanical skills, and, as I already said, I can't deal with this problem.
I hope the fridge's working at least.
And I mended the freezer too. 

It might have been something to do with the demonstration against that pharmaceutical company.
这可能与那场反对那家制药公司的示威活动有关。

That's all very well in theory
理论上这一切都很好（但实际未必可行）。
But it doesn't working in practice, does it?

We freeze to death, unitl we can find someone who'll fix it for free?

If I known how ro repair it, I would have repaired it.
Is she been__ a cop, she just__ rung off when I answered.
She wouldn't have left her phone number, she'd have called back later.
If it had been anything really serious, the Germans would have contacted me directly.

Meanwhile, the New York Police Department is looking into the theory that a local organization may have helped to carry out the kidnapping.
与此同时，纽约警察局正在调查一种说法 —— 某个当地组织可能协助实施了这起绑架案。
Mr. Lembach was kidnapped two days ago, apparently, by a group of evironmentalist terrorists.
显然，这是一群极端环保主义者所为。

I'd have gone to visit her if I'd known she was in the hospital.
If it had been serious, my mother would have called me on my cell phone.
If John hadn't goine through the red light, the police wouldn't have stopped him.
If we'd had time, we'd have cooked dinner.

The President's daughter has been kidnapped; it is not yet known who is responsible.
No one has been in touch with the President's office about it yet, apparently.
Most medicines are produced by Western pharmaceutical companies.
An autonomous, language user is someone who doesn't depend on dictionaries or translations.
一个独立的语言使用者是指不依赖词典或翻译的人。
If we grew out own fruit and vegetables we could be more or less self-sufficient.
如果我们自己种植水果和蔬菜，我们就能或多或少实现自给自足。
That's a very interesting theory, but how can you prove that it's true?

If you don't fix the heating, we are going to freeze to death.
I can't afford this; It's terribly expensive!
When I tell you hands off, I mean it, it's all mine.
I cannot wait to meet your mother; in fact, I am dying to meet her.
That book is so interesting that I can't stop reading it.


We sleep on a double bed.
Jamie has an electric cooker.
Her aparment is just a short walk away from the supermarket.
My new apartment is 100 square meters.
Her furniture is all leather.
I especially love her sofa because it is very soft.
We park our car in the garage.
It is so cold in here! Isn't the central heating working?
Help yourself to a drink. There's ice in the freezer.

If I'd have enough money, I might have rented that apartment.
The toilet works again; the plumber may already have fixed it.
Martin's very smart; he should be able to fix the problem.
The char is made of leather.
While we're on the subject of cops, didn't you get a speeding ticket yesterday?
既然我们谈到了警察，你昨天不是收到了一张超速罚单吗？
No one is believed to know the whereabouts of the missing industralist.
人们认为，无人知晓那位失踪实业家的下落。
Would you be so kind as to give her a message?
能否劳烦你给她捎个口信？
be so kind as to：固定表达，相当于 “劳烦、恳请”，是礼貌程度升级的核心。

Where did Liliane get her information about David's father? She heard about it.
What about Annie want when she calls? She wants to talk to David about something.
Why does Annie want to meet David at his apartment? because it is warmer than the park.
Why does Annie interrupt David when he is telling her his address? because she knows how to get there.
What does Annie do? She works for a magazine and holds meeting regarding environmental issues.
Why does Annie want to leave with David? She wants to talk to David alone.
Why does Juanita become angry? because Annie doesn't want to tell her anything.
What is David worried about? that Annie is involved with criminals.

It's all right. I'll get it!
No you won't; I'll get it!
Can I have a word with David?
What's it about?
It's nothing important.
Could I just speak to him, please?
Look David, I've got to talk to you urgently.


What __ we met in the park?
Haven't you noticed, David, it's snowing!
I'd rather we met at your place.
I't 188 West 105th Street, and we're in the basement.
188: one eight eight
105th: one hundred fifth.
When you get to No. 188, go down the steps outside.
当你到达188号时，沿着外面的台阶走。
188: one eight eight

Is it true that David's father was a member of an international criminal gang, and that he was murdered by his boss?
I wouldn't have married Daivd if he'd been the son of a criminal.

I hear you're this wildly radical environmentalist.
我听说你是个激进的环保主义者。
wildly:非常,极其
radical:激进的,极端的
I guess you could say that.
How exciting!
Do you go around blowing up nuclear power stations?
No, I had edited__ a magazine, 

Say hello to your aunt Annie.
I'd rather you didn't call me aunt.
What would you rather I called you, then - uncle?

Listen David, can we have a word - in private?
Look, this really isn't a great moment.
Unless it's really important we'd better leave it for now.
除非事情真的很重要，否则我们最好先放一放。
I wouldn't have come here if it hadn't been important, would I?
This is hopeless; we can't talk here.
这根本行不通，我们没法在这里谈。
We'll have to go to a coffee shop or something.

And as for all this business about the kidnapping - I just don't want anything to do with it.


If he had been poor, I never would have married him.
Would you have hired him if he had been rude during the interview?
I would have visited her at the hospital if I had known about her illness.
He wouldn't have said anything about it, would he?
If I had won a million dollars, I would have stopped working.
What would you have said if he had recognized you?
I would have quit my job if I had had to work so many hours.
He would have helped me if I had needed him to, wouldn't he?

Be careful with that man. He's known to be a member of a violent gang.
The police arrested him for murdering his wife.
He is a criminal because he stole a lot of money.
He is a radical politician; he has some crazy ideas about how to change the world.
The terrorists were responsible for the car explosion.
No one knows who kidnapped the child.
They used gas tanks to blow up the building.

The man rents an apartment at the bottom of the house in the basement.
When you get to the corner, you can wait for me.
Do you want to meet at my place or yours?
Just go down the steps.
I'll be waiting for you right outside in the garden.
Which street is the house on?

I really don't want to do this now unless it's really necessary.
If it's really urgent, I can speak now.
Can we please talk now, and in private?
The situation is looking hopeless; we must do something immediately.
I said it was important; otherwise I wouldn't have come here.
I wouldn't have bothered you if it hadn't been absolutely necessary.
