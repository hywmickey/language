句子结构分析
    句子类型：简单句（含多个状语成分）
    成分拆解：
        时间状语：After the accident（介词短语作时间状语，明确动作发生的背景）
        主语：people
        谓语：came（核心谓语动词，表 “到来” 的动作）
        方式状语 1：running down the streets（现在分词短语作伴随状语，说明 “came” 的方式 —— 沿街奔跑）
        方式状语 2：screaming and crying（并列现在分词短语作伴随状语，补充说明人们奔跑时的状态 —— 尖叫、哭喊，与 “running” 同时发生）
    核心语法点：
        介词短语作时间状语（“After + 名词” 结构，表 “在…… 之后”）；
        现在分词作伴随状语（多个现在分词并列，逻辑主语均为 “people”，表同时发生的动作 / 状态）；
        “come + doing” 固定结构，表示 “过来做某事”，强调动作的主动性和方向性。
同义改写
    正式版：Subsequent to the accident, crowds poured into the streets, shrieking and weeping.（改写思路：替换 “After” 为正式介词短语 “Subsequent to”，“people” 为 “crowds”（更强调 “人群”），“came running down” 为 “poured into”（表 “涌入”，更具画面感），“screaming and crying” 为 “shrieking and weeping”（更正式的书面词汇）；译文：事故发生后，人群涌入街道，尖叫着、哭泣着。）
    口语版：Right after the accident, folks came running down the roads, yelling and sobbing.（改写思路：用 “Right after” 增强口语中的时间紧迫感，“folks” 替代 “people”（口语常用），“roads” 替代 “streets”（口语中可通用），“yelling and sobbing” 替代 “screaming and crying”（更贴近日常口语表达）；译文：事故刚一发生，大伙就沿街跑过来，大喊着、抽泣着。）
    书面简洁版：After the accident, people rushed down the streets, screaming and weeping.（改写思路：用 “rushed” 直接替代 “came running”，压缩冗余表达，保留核心语义，同时 “weeping” 比 “crying” 更具书面简洁感；译文：事故后，人们沿街奔来，尖叫哭泣。）
拓展例句
    After the earthquake, residents fled their homes, carrying their children and shouting for help.（地震发生后，居民们逃离家园，抱着孩子、呼喊求救。）

THE SAHARA DESERT

The Sahara Desert, spanning a large part of North Africa, is the biggest desert in the world outside of the polar regions. It is between 800 and 1,200 miles wide and is at least 3, 000 miles long. It covers about one-third of the African continent and is mainly part of 11 countries in Africa, and is believed to be expanding. In fact, the Sahara is so big that it divides Africa into two regions. The Atlantic Ocean borders it on the west, the Red Sea on the east, and the Atlas Mountains and Mediterranean Sea on the North. The name Sahara is derived from the Arabic word meaning desert.

When one thinks of the Sahara, one thinks of sand, and that would be a fairly accurate description of the desert. However, is not just a flat expanse of sand. In fact, the highest point of the Sahara is Mount Koussi, at 11,204 feet, and the lowest part of the desert is in the Qattara Depression in Egypt at 436 feet. The Sahara consists of gravel-covered plains, shallow basins, plateaus, mountains, oases, sand sheets, dunes and sand seas. Sand sheets and dunes cover more than 25 percent of the Sahara's surface. Some of these dunes are over 600 feet high, and no one really knows how these dunes were formed. In addition to the dunes,sand also comes in another form-sandstorms. During a sandstorm, the skies are covered with clouds, and sand blows with full force everywhere.

There are countless rivers that form outside of the Sahara but then enter the Sahara through waterways under the ground. In the southern Sahara, the majority of the water orginates from the Nile River and the other rivers that to into the Mediterranean. Other rivers flow into Lake Chad, a freshwater lake, which also lies in the southern Sahara. In the north, the majority of the water flows from the Atlas Mountains and highlands of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia.

The climate of the Sahara is quite unique due to both dry and humid conditions in short to medium periods of time of its history. For the past 2, 000 years, the Saharan climate has remained more or less the same, except for a span of time in the 1500s and 1700s when the "Little Ice Age" took place in Europe. This ice age increased the precipitation over the desert until the 1800s.

The Sahara's climate is comprised of basically two sub-climates. In the north is a dry subtropical climate. This means cold winters, annually high temperature ranges, very hot summers, and two rainy seasons, with the majority of the rain falling in Auguest when flash floods send water to desert areas that usually don't get much rain. The southern part of the Sahara has a dry tropical clinate, with mild and dry winters, a hot dry season, adn a rainy season. Precipitation here is not just limited to rain, however. Snow can fall in higher elevations. The western part of this region is a bit cooler, thanks to the cold Canary Current.

One thing which is true of the sparse vegetation in the Sahara is that all the species are able to adapt to the unpredictable precipitation and high heat in the region. The plant life in the region includes trees, grasses, shrubs, and trees. In addition to plants, there are several animals, which include mammals, repitles, and birds, that live in the Sahara. These range from the desert hedgehog and anubis baboon among the mammals, to frogs and crocodiles, among the reptiles. Ostriches and barn owls are among the over 300 species of birds found in the Sahara.

The Sahara Desert covers more than 3.5 million square miles, yet it has only about 2 million inhabitants. This means about 1 person per square mile, making it one of the least densely populated areas in the world. Hardly surprising considering that the Sahara is one of the harshest environments in the world. However, thousands of years ago, the Sahara desert was more populated than it is today, due to a different climate than that of today. Archaeological findings of such items as fossils, stone artifacts, rock art, bone harpoons, shells, and aquatic animals suggest an abundance of water in the Sahara which made for much more habitable conditions.

Nomads, people who continuously move from place to place, make up the majority of the inhabitants of the Sahara Desert. It is believed that the first nomads arrived to this area 7,000 years ago with the arrival of domestic animals, likely brought to area by the Caspian culture of northern Africa. In addition to the nomads, other groups also lived in separate groups in the desert, but it is believed that the nomads were the ones who contributed to the development of trade among these groups and with other countries.
