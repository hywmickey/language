GROSSMAN: FOOTBALL'S NEW SUPERSTAR By Kristi Schmidt.
Hundreds of journalists from all over Europe were at New York's Newark Airport this afternoon to meet Germany's football superstar Manfred Grossman who was arriving for next Wednessday's World Cup match against Italy.
What has Grossman got that's so special? Last year he earned over three million euros, and it's impossible these days to open a newspaper without seeing his name.
After all, you're just a footballer, not an Einstein or a Schopenhauer. So why are people so interested in you? I ask him So, how many World Cup goals has his Schopenhaer guy scored? I told him that Schopenhauer was a philosopher.
I'm a philosopher, too. I'll tell you my philosophy, Grossman answered. You need exactly the same thing in football as you need in life; only in life, you need two of them. Do you get it?
I got it.

I hope I haven't broken it.
I've just had an idea.
How long has he been there?
He's been there for three months.
We haven't arrested enough people this month.
Don't come back until you've found something.
I haven't taken my stuff to the laundromat.
I've brought the tickets you wanted.
I haven't made the cake yet.
I've lived here fro ten years.

He's German's football superstar!
Manfred Grossman was arriving for the match against Italy.
How many goals has he scored?
Grossman scores a lot in a match.
Let's have a word with a typical fan(让我们来和一位典型的粉丝聊一聊).
He's a famous footballer.
The match is called the World Cup.
I have to buy tickets for the match.
I've never played golf before.
I don't have any golf clubs(杆).

Who comes to Marco's room? Mary.
What does Mary invite Marco to? to a party.

Did you see a young man here a moment ago?
No, of course not.
I've just come in.
I thought I saw a yong man.
I was right; I did see a young man!
I told you there was a young man around.

I've got some slivovitsa.
it's a Romanian drink, a bit like brandy, but it's made from plums.
It's strong, isn't it?
I haven't got anyting to drink, I'm afraid. Not even coffee.
It's all right, I'm not thirsty.

Try to get to sleep.
How can I get to sleep with that noise?
Are they having a party, or something?
My wife gets very excited(受刺激的；紧张不安的).
Maybe if you try to be quieter...
Now, but you close the door, please.

I've invited a friend to have a drink with me.
And it's not your business, anyway.
Maybe it's better if I go now.
You don't have to go, Marco.
Why don't we go to your place?
You have to get up early tomorrow, don't you?

I didn't expect to see you（我没想到会见到你）.
Do I have to make an appointment, then?
Do I have to call you secretary and ask: May I see Mr.Benini for five minutes sometime?
And I thought we were friends.


I thought I saw a young man.
I told you I heard a noise.
I thought we were friends.
Mary thought Kristi was Marco's girlfriend.
The receptionist told Kristi she could have her key.

Let's see what there is to drink.
I've got some slivovitsa.
It's a Romanian drink.
It's like brandy.
It's made from plums.
Ooh! It's strong, isn't it?
I've invited a friend to have a drink with me.
I haven't got anything to drink. Not even coffee.
I'm not thirsty.

Don't worry about it.

Yeah, soure, I like opera.
Of course, we're friends.
I was right, I did see a young man.
The elevator is the other way.

I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
I'm sorry, but I have to be careful.
My wife doesn't sleep well, and she gets very excited.
I'm not tired anymore. Let's go. It'll be fun.
Safe at last!
I'm glad she's gone.

I certainly do want to complain.
I'm complaining about something else.
I am complaining about the person next door in room 38.
she had a young man in her room, and made a terrible noise.
I am going to change hotels.
Are you sure? I am quite sure. thank you!

Kschmiclt@ngtv.org.de
Hi Kristi, 
Look, I'm very soory about what happened the other night. I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me; I don't have hundreds of girlfriends.
In face, I don't have a girlfriend at all at the moment; Mary is just a friend, that's all. I didn't expect to see her that night; we didn't have a date, or anything. I mean it(我是认真的); please belive me.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I really like you a lot, Kristi. I had a very good time at the match with you. What happened at your hotel and back here was all really quite funny, wasn't it? I hope we can forget about it all and try again soon.
I remember you said that you like opera. Well, I've brought two tickets for Puccini's Madam Butterfly next Friday. I hope you can come; I've thought about you a lot sice the other evening.
Call me or email me to let me know.
Hope to see you again soon. Marco Benini.

Did I see you at school?
Julio invited Nadine to the party.
She got excited about her new car.
I came to visit my friend.
I am sorry about what happened last night.
I wanted to tell you I like you.
I told you I saw the teacher at the restaurant.
I had a good time at the match yesterday.
I bought two tickets to the opera.
I didn't know you were here. I thought you were at the hotel.

Where is Gabe? Washington,D.C
What time of day is it? morning.
Washington, D.C. is a city.
What kinds of things are the people buying? fruits and vegetables.
What is the sales philosophy? to sell a great product at a good price.

Are we supposed to look for soft ones?
You want the firmer ones.
This is the very end of the plum season.

What are you buying today?
We're buying different fruits and vegetables for our weekly shopping trip.
And what have you bought?
We bought_ plums first.
We've already purchased our flowers for the week.
Why do you like plums? What do you do with them?
We can make jellies, jams, or pies.

It's a neighborhood market.
Not only is it a market, but it's also a gathering place, much like the market in old Europe.
Most of the food sold here comes from the  mid-Atlantic region : Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland and Delavare.
I don't think there's anything grew in Washington that we could sell here.
So we go to the country and bring food in.

I just bought one of my favorites: some radishes, which doesn't sound very exciting.
Actually, they're not noly good in salads, but I also like to saute them.
I slice them very thin, and saute them in garlic, butter and parsley.
I like to buy fresh vegetables mainly because I like working with them.
I like the texture.
I like the smell, especially the smell of fresh herbs.
It's much nicer to work with something fresh, than opening a can, or reaching into the freezer.

We decided to buy some pumpkins to decorate the front of our house for Halloween.
We buy a lot of vegetables, because we tend to eat more at home.
We tend to make a lot of eggplant and bean dishes.
We like to eat a lot of fruit, because it's healthy.


We are at the Eastern Market in Washington,D.C.
It's the last open-air market in the Washington,D.C. city.
It's a neighborhood market.
It's like old Europe.
The food comes from the mid-Atlantic region.
The mid-Atlantic region is Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland and Delavare.
They bring food in from the country.
You can meet people from as close as four blocks away to as far as forty miles away.

Radishes are not only good in salads, but I like to saute them.
Not only is it a market, but it's a gathering place.

What the hell do you think you're doing?
You're putting gasoline in my tank!
Where did you want me to put it?

It's this fool attendent of yours.

Dear Mr.Berry
I am writing to you about an incident that happened at the Go West Gas Station on Wednesday March 19th.
You will of course remember that at that time you were an attendant at the gas station, employed by my client Mr.Bert Cashbox.
My client tells me that a truck belonging to the Assoil Fuel Corporation came into the Go West Gas Station on that morning, and the drive asked you to fill the tank.
You filled his tank with gasoline, my client tells me, and he has just had a letter from the lawyer of the Assoil Fue Corporation asking for $12850 to pay for the damage to the truck.
I am asking you, Mr Berry, to pay this, plus my own costs, which comes to $20,000 in all. I am sure you would not like me to put this into anyone else's hands. If you see what I mean.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Yours.
N.G.Sinistri

Please put the book on the table.
The boy fell off his bed.
Marco had English class on Tuesday.
Lei almost died in the accident yesterday.
Mary showed Kristi the bus stop.
The waiter filled the glass with wine.
Haven't you learned another language?
Mr.Beacon fired Viktor.
Haven't you slod your car?
Haven't you been to the United States?
I have no money so I can't afford a vacation.
I thought John worked here.
