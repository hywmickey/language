GROSSMAN: FOOTBALL'S NEW SUPERSTAR By Kristi Schmidt.
Hundreds of journalists from all over Europe were at New York's Newark Airport this afternoon to meet Germany's football superstar Manfred Grossman who was arriving for next Wednessday's World Cup match against Italy.
What has Grossman got that's so special? Last year he earned over three million euros, and it's impossible these days to open a newspaper without seeing his name.
After all, you're just a footballer, not an Einstein or a Schopenhauer. So why are people so interested in you? I ask him So, how many World Cup goals has his Schopenhaer guy scored? I told him that Schopenhauer was a philosopher.
I'm a philosopher, too. I'll tell you my philosophy, Grossman answered. You need exactly the same thing in football as you need in life; only in life, you need two of them. Do you get it?
I got it.

I hope I haven't broken it.
I've just had an idea.
How long has he been there?
He's been there for three months.
We haven't arrested enough people this month.
Don't come back until you've found something.
I haven't taken my stuff to the laundromat.
I've brought the tickets you wanted.
I haven't made the cake yet.
I've lived here fro ten years.

He's German's football superstar!
Manfred Grossman was arriving for the match against Italy.
How many goals has he scored?
Grossman scores a lot in a match.
Let's have a word with a typical fan(让我们来和一位典型的粉丝聊一聊).
He's a famous footballer.
The match is called the World Cup.
I have to buy tickets for the match.
I've never played golf before.
I don't have any golf clubs(杆).
