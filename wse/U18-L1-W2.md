I usually have sheets on my bed.
Have you looked on the antique furniture?

Have you fond anything yet, Bedges.
Just some magazines.
What do you think you on__?
Put that magazine down!
There's a police car outside the house.
Who have they come for?

I'm glad you bought apartment 3C now.
I didn't like it first, but I do now.
It really wasn't easy to sell 3A.
Anyway, I sold it now, and I still got a good price.
I think 3C's much nicer.
It's bigger than 3A, and I perfer the color.

What hell up are you doing here?
Be careful how you talk to me, Mr.Peters.
I've got two of my men in your apartment at this moment.
You have no right to do that! No right at all!
Oh, yes, I do!
Why are you laughing? What's so funny?

Why don't we go for a meal?
I have to get up early tomorrow.
I have to catch up a plane to London.
Oh, I see, what a pity!

So the score is still Germany two, Italy one.
Only two minutes to go, and it's almost over now for Italy.
They have to score another goal.
If they lose this match, they'll be out of the World Cup.
German is still in control.
How different the two teams are!
The Germans play like machines.
The Italians have missed three or four chances already.
It's a goal!
It's a draw!

Thye have to score another goal.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
I have to catch a plane to London.
We have to eat a meal at the Chinese restaurant.
You have to have a drink at the hotel.
They have to win the World Cup.


They'll be out of the World Cup if they lose this match.
If he's got the ball, he'll score.
They'll win if they get the goal they need.
If you are hungry, we can have a meal at the Chinese restaurant.
We can just have a drink at the hotel, if you have to get up early.

Grossman's got the ball.
The Italians have missed three or four chances.
We've got more points! We're going to win.
The final score is Germany two, Italy two, It's a draw.
