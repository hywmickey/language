THE SPIRIT BEAR

Imagine seven white bear cubs, but the mothers are all black bears. What are the chances? According to research, the chances are about one in ten among theblack bears known as the Kermode bear, or the Spirit Bear, in British Columbia, Canada. According to local legend, the indigenous people of that region believe that a raven came to earth and turned one out of every ten bears white in order to show people how clean the world was during the Ice Age. However, scientists have found that a recessive gene in the Kermode bear accounts for the birth of a white cub. They have officially been named Kermode bears after Francis Kermode, who studied them extensively in the early 1900s, but they are called Moksgm' ol-which means white bear - by the Gitga's at people who live locally.

Loggin companies used to be allowed to cut trees and destroy much of the rainforest that exists in that part of North America. However, in February 2006, an agreement was made and officially declared by the Canadian government which would make the bears' home a national park. It is one of North America's most abundant wildlife surroundings - the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada, which lies on British Columbia's north coast. The home of the bears lies in a 15.5 million acre area of land on the Pacific Coast, 4.4 million acres of which would become a park. As part of the agreement, logging companies will no longer have a right to cut trees in the protected areas. Today, there are only about a hundred of these white bears in the British Columbia area, and it is thanks to them that the area is being preserved.

One of the people most familiar with the Spirit Bear is Marven Robinson, a conservationist and Spirit Bear guide. He says that a bear will occasionally be hidden from view in the sort of dense grass that exists in the park, and then stand up to full height right in front of a human being. However, he says that it is not dangerous even if the bear is only ten feet away because the bear's only wish is to get a good look at the person. Robinson, one of a handful of guides in the world who is a Spirit Bear guide, is happy that tourists want to come and see the Spirit Bear. Without the tourists, the rainforest might not have gotten enough publicity to protect its animals and force the Canadian government to act. Robinson says that with the autumn tourist season coming closer, he is in search of these rare black bears with white fur. The bears are difficult to find, but even the possibility of meeting one is attracting more and more tourists to the remote area.

Before crossing the grassy land, Robinson adjusts his backpack and makes sure that he is able to reach his can of pepper spray. He explains that he encountered a tense situation last year when he had the spray in open view. An enormous female bear came right up to him and hit him several times with her snout. Robinson remembers having an aggressive stance, and that the female bear became aggressive as well and just kept hitting him. In the end, he decided not to spray her.

As soon as he threw the spray can away from him, the bear calmed down and stopped hitting him. Then, the bear rummaged through his backpack, but not finding anything to eat since Robinson doesn't permit food close to bear sites, she rolled around on jackets lying near Robinson.

Robinson says rain can improve the chances of seeing a Spirit Bear. He says if there has been a lot of rain, there will be a lot of salmon, which will most likely attract the bears. If the summer has been long and dry, the salmon population is low, and the bears then spend most of their feeding tine eating berries deep in the forest. But, even if there is lot of salmon in the 499 salmon watersheds in the 22, 170 square mile Great Bear Rainforest, less than 20 percent of these watersheds have full protection which raises concerns about the bears' future.

Legalized hunting of costal black bears is also a worry for those who want to protect the Spirit Bear. Given that the parents of the white bears often have black fur, the Spirit Bear could be in danger. Today, there are about 1,200 black and white Kermode bears in the coastal forest and nobody knows what their fate will be. But, Robinson still guides people in their search of the faned bear. He says that he usually doesn't tell the people who come to see the white bears to expect that they will see one. That way, if they don't see on, they are satisfied walking throug and seeing nature that has been protected thanks to these white bears. On the other hand, if they do see a white bear, they are in awe at the sight.
