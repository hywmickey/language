I don't have anyone to talk to.
I just want to talk to you, that's all.
Oh, all right! But only for 10 minutes.
I have a lot of things to do.

It's not exactly near here, my dear.
Well, how far is it?
It's a long way.
You go up this road, make a left, make a right, and then you see it.
It's on this side of the road.
You go out of the building, firt make a right, then a left, and there it is, on the other side of the road.

Don't be rediculous, Peter!
My god! / Good heavens!
Let me help you.
Oh, my head!
My CDs are all broken!
Very well, if you like. I don't mind.

When are you getting married?
We're not getting married. It's over.
Well, are you doing anything tonight?
No, I'm busy. Sorry.
Well, another time, perhaps?
How long are you staying in New York?
For a year, maybe more.

I'm looking for a job here.
Oh, you're looking for a job. Maybe I can help you.
I'm an executive with a multinational corporation.
I can find a job for you.
Thanks; maybe I'll call you at work.

What's he doing here? You must be carefull, Hugo.
The police know about you now, don't they?
No, they don't now anything! Everything's all right, Peter.
I think I'll phone Jack Cooper anyway.

Who is that man?
Oh, he lives next door. He's a fool.

Never mind him, He's no problem.
The man's a complete fool.
Jack breaks John's furniture. He is very violent.
