The staff weren't properly trained, or managed.
If you're managing salespeople you have to be hands on.
如果你在管理销售人员，就必须亲力亲为。
You have to be right in there, leading from the front.
你得亲自投身其中，带头引领大家(冲锋在前)。
That's why I spend most of the time in my stores, working directly with salespeople - and customers.
这就是为什么我大部分时间都待在店里，直接与销售人员和顾客打交道。
Good salespeople are very competitive.
优秀的销售人员都很有竞争力。
If you're their boss you have to show them that you're the best. 
Otherwise they won't respect you.

The sucess of Chinese fashion is 90% down to low prices, rather than good design.
中国时尚的成功90%归功于低廉的价格，而非优秀的设计。
down to：归结为/取决于（强调根本原因）
We have a 5000-year history of art and design.
We have some of the best designer in the world here in China.
And as for price, if you can make a better product at a lower price, you're going to be sucessful.
至于价格，如果你能以更低的价格生产出更好的产品，你将会获得成功。
as for: 至于
What about the idea that Chinese fashion houses mainly just copy European designs?
关于中国时尚品牌主要只是抄袭欧洲设计的观点，你怎么看？
“fashion houses” 此处指 “时尚品牌、时装屋”，而非字面意义的 “房子”，是行业常用表达。
“mainly just” 叠加使用，强化 “主要只是、多半只是” 的语气，翻译时保留这一强调意味。
Soon the Europeans will be trying to copy us.
They won't be able to compete with your prices.

I haven't been feeling well lately.
lately: 最近；近来；新近；不久前
I've been getting varous aches and pains, and I've lost a lot of weight too.
I went to the doctor for a check-up, and he says I've got cancer.
I'm going to have to go into a specialist clinic for treatment.
specialist clinic: 专科诊所; 专家门诊
How come they didn't find it before?
How come： 为什么；怎么会…（那样）
I haven't had a properly check-up for several years.
我已经好几年没有做过正规的体检了。
“proper check-up” 是固定搭配，意为 “正规体检”
I'm sure you'll be all right.
You have the best medical treatment in the world in the US.

I'm going to have to pull out of our deal.
我将不得不退出我们的交易。
pull out of: 退出
Maybe you'd better think again about your trip to New York - unless you can find another partner.
I'll have to cancel my trip and postpone the store, unless I try Mark.
除非我试试马克，否则我将不得不取消出行并推迟开店。
postpone: 推迟;延期;延迟;展缓




Unless European fashion houses can sell their products for less money, the Chinese fashion designers will continue to be more successful.
I'm going to have to pull out of our deal, unless I get better.
Unless Pauline finds a new partner, she'll have to wait to open the store.

I haven't been feeling well lately.
I've been getting various aches and pains.
I've lost a lot of weight, too.
Becuase of that, I went to the doctor for a check-up.
He says I've got cancer.
Now I'm going to have to go into a specialist clinic for treatment.
They didn't find it before because I haven't had a proper check-up for serveral years.
I hope I'll be all right. After all, we have the best medical treatment in the world in the US.



I have an appointment with Mr. Jones for 2:30.
It's great to see you too.
I'm all right, I guess. How about you?
Jonathan, I'd like to introduct my friend, Micheal. Micheal, this is Jonathan.
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.
Oh, very well, but I'm afraid I have to leave now.
Yes, you see, I've got to catch the last train home.
Thank you for inviting me to the party anyway, Jonathan. It was great.
Yeah, we must see each other soon. Well, so long, Jonathan.
