I'll stay outside with the luggage cart, then.

Let me put your luggage in the trunk.

You remind me of someone I used to know.
I've just realized who you remind me of!
我刚刚意识到你让我想起了谁！
You look exactly like someone I used to know called Hugo Peters, only he had a beard and mustache.
beard：：胡须（总称），特指生长在下巴、脸颊两侧、下颌线的胡须，通常不包含上唇的 mustache（若需包含，需明确说明）。日常语境中，beard 可指从下巴延伸到脸颊的整片胡须，是面部下半部分胡须的 “整体统称”。

I've got to find him immediately.
Find whom?
Mr. Gusper!
Let me see ... Yes, he checked in today.
I'm afraid Mr. Gusper has gone out to lunch.
A young lady came to collect him about five minutes ago.
大概五分钟前，有位年轻姑娘来接他了。

 as you approach: 当你靠近 / 抵达…… 时，as 此处引导时间状语从句，表 “动作发生的时机”；approach 为动词，意为 “靠近、临近”，比 when you get close to 更正式，适配官方场景。

We apologize for the delay. We'd like to invite our passengers to have a drink in the lounge.
If my plane arrives late, I'll miss my connecting flight!
要是我这趟飞机晚点了，我就赶不上联程航班了！

You look like my mother and you even sound just like her.
just 表 “简直、完全、丝毫不差”
You remind me of a guy I used to know in high school.

You look exactly like my neighbor except that he doesn't wear glasses.
你和我的邻居长得一模一样，只是/除了/就是他不戴眼镜。
Your accent is exactly like my Korean friend's accent, only you are not Korean.

He does not remind me of my boss at all.
The shape of your face is exactly like my husdband's, however, his is clean-shaven but you have a beard.
你的脸型和我丈夫的一模一样，然而，他的胡子刮得很干净，但你留着胡子。

Dear Annie,
It was very nice to see you the other day, even though we hardly had a chance to talk to each other properly.
I'm very sorry to have wasted your time trying to sell you a washine machine, I should have realized that fanatical Greens don't like their clothes clean(my little joke). Of course, if you've changed your mind about the machine, you know where to get hold of me.
Anyway, that isn't the reason why I'm writing - although, if you were interested in a machine, I'd be happy to demostrate one to you - is to apologize for upsetting you by talking about your late father Hugo.
I really shouldn't have mentioned him after all, he was your only father, if you see what I mean.
The other reason why I'm writing to you, as well of course as offering you another chance to buy a Laundroperk machine, is to tell you about a rather interesting customer I picked up at JFK airport the other day.
(I drive a cab now, you see, which is why I collect this person at the airport, as I said)
The point is, this guy I collected looked exactly like Hugo, except for the beard and mustache, he didn't have them, that is, but Hugo did, as I'm sure you remember.
I asked him if he'd ever heard of Hugo, but he said he hadn't, in fact, he seemed to be quite offended, and he got out of my cab without paying! Just think, there's someone else around who looks just like your poor dead father!
The other reason I'm writing to you is to suggest that we get together for a chat about old times, your Dad, maybe washing machines, and stuff like that. Perhaps we could go to a club one evening?
Looking forward to hearing from you.
P. S. If you don't need a washing machine, perhaps a friend of yours does?
Sorry to go on about it, but if you are interested in the Laundroperk machine, could you let me know soon, so that I can get in touch with the company that sells them?
fanatical Greens: 狂热的绿党

The car park, where all the other cars are, is right outside the hotel.
These cigars, which I bought at the duty-free shop, are from Cuba.
Do you have any insurance for your car which is illegally parked?
You look like someone whom I used to know.
The car, when you accelerate, has a top speed of over 90.
I've stopped a guy who claims to be a cab-driver.
He picked up a man called Theo Gusper, who looked exactly like Hugo Peters.
John, whose car is very old, didn't see the red light.
I know a garage where you can have your car repaired.
Do you remember the day when John arrived late for work?
The customer, whom John recognized, said his name was Gusper.
There's the man whose car was towed away!

If we are going to buy a lot of things, let's at least get a shopping cart.
If I ask you about a demostic product, I am asking you about something which is made in your country.
He offended her by guessing that her age was older than it is really is.
How can I remove these spots from the windows?
Henry is really starting to be a nuisance: he is always knocking on my door to ask a stupid question.
Let's buy something at the duty-free shop before getting on the plane.
This problem is due to your lack of effort.
Please make the check payable to me.
请把支票抬头写我。
请把支票开具为可支付给我的形式。
请将支票收款人填写为本人。
这张支票请抬头写我。
payable to ： 应付给；收款人；支票抬头；支票抬头请写
You can really feel the acceleration of this car when it goes fast.
If you want to stop, just put your foot down on the brakes.
如果你想停车，只需踩下刹车。

翻译：Passengers with connecting flights to destinations within the United States need not go through Immigration Control, but should go straight to the Domestic Departures lounge.

一、核心翻译（直译+场景化正式表达）
- **直译**：前往美国境内目的地、搭乘联程航班的乘客无需经过入境边防检查，但需直接前往国内出发候机厅。
- **机场官方标准翻译**：**搭乘美国境内联程航班的旅客，无需办理入境边检手续，可直接前往国内出发候机厅。**
- **口语简化版（广播/指引）**：美国国内联程旅客不用过边检，直接去国内出发候机厅即可。

（注：原句为**机场转机官方指引**，翻译需兼顾专业性和实用性——术语精准、语句简洁，符合旅客快速获取信息的需求，同时避免口语化表达导致歧义。）

二、关键术语/短语深度解析（贴合航空场景）
1. Passengers with connecting flights
- **译法**：搭乘联程航班的乘客/联程旅客  
- **术语说明**：`connecting flights` 指**联程航班**（同一张机票、需转机但无需重新托运行李的航班），区别于 `transfer flights`（泛指转机航班，可含不同航空公司）；`with` 译为“搭乘”而非“拥有”，贴合航空场景语义。
- **搭配例句**：Passengers with connecting flights please wait at Gate 5.（搭乘联程航班的旅客请在5号登机口等候。）

2. destinations within the United States
- **译法**：美国境内目的地  
- **语境强调**：`within` 明确“境内”，是翻译核心——正因为是**美国国内转机**，才无需过入境边检（若为国际转机则需办理），语义逻辑不可省略。
- **同义替换**：U.S. domestic destinations（更简洁，机场标识常用）

3. need not go through
- **译法**：无需经过/无需办理  
- **语法解析**：`need not` 是**情态动词用法**，表“不必”，比 `do not need to` 更正式，适配官方通知场景；`go through` 此处意为“通过（官方手续/检查）”，而非“穿过（空间）”。
- **场景例句**：You need not go through security again for domestic transfers.（国内转机无需再次过安检。）

4. Immigration Control
- **译法**：入境边防检查（简称“边检”）  
- **专业说明**：航空场景核心术语，指跨国出行时的**入境身份核查**（检查护照、签证等），不可译为“移民控制”（字面义，不符合中文机场表述）；国内转机无需此环节，国际转机必须办理。
- **对应场景**：机场标识常缩写为 **Immigration** 或 **边检**。

5. Domestic Departures lounge
- **译法**：国内出发候机厅  
- **术语拆解**：`Domestic Departures`（国内出发，机场固定标识），`lounge` 此处特指“旅客候机的专用区域”，译为“候机厅”而非“休息室”（避免与机场VIP休息室混淆）。
- **简化标识**：机场常见缩写为 **Domestic Departures**（无需译出lounge，标识牌已明确功能）。

三、句子结构与翻译逻辑（贴合中文表达习惯）
原句是 **转折关系并列句**（but连接），英文重心在前，中文翻译时调整为**重心在后**，更符合中文“先前提条件，后核心指引”的逻辑：
1. 英文原序：乘客（条件：联程+美国境内）→ 无需过边检 → 但需去国内出发厅  
2. 中文调整：（条件前置）搭乘美国境内联程航班的旅客 → （核心动作1）无需办理边检 → （核心动作2）直接前往国内出发厅  
→ 调整原因：中文通知类文本习惯“条件先行”，让旅客快速定位自身是否适用该指引。

四、同义句替换（适配不同场景）
1.  **机场广播版（更简洁）**：Passengers connecting to U.S. domestic flights are exempt from Immigration Control and should proceed directly to the Domestic Departures lounge.  
    （对应中文：美国国内联程旅客免办入境边检，直接前往国内出发候机厅。）
2.  **书面通知版（更正式）**：Travelers with onward domestic flights within the United States do not need to complete Immigration formalities; instead, they shall proceed straight to the Domestic Departures area.  
    （对应中文：搭乘美国境内后续国内航班的旅客无需办理入境手续，需直接前往国内出发区域。）
3.  **标识牌极简版**：Domestic Connecting Flights: No Immigration → Direct to Domestic Departures  
    （对应中文：国内联程：无需边检 → 直达国内出发）



我可以帮你将这句翻译适配成机场广播稿（中英文对照）、登机口指引牌文字等具体形式，需要吗？

only 表 “只是、只不过” 的高频例句

这种用法在日常口语中极为常见，尤其适合描述 “整体符合、仅一处例外” 的场景：

1. The movie is great, only it’s a bit too long.（这部电影很棒，只是有点太长了。）
2. This dress fits perfectly, only the color is not my favorite.（这条裙子版型超合适，只不过颜色不是我喜欢的。）
3. He plays the guitar exactly like a professional, only he has never taken any lessons.（他弹吉他简直像专业选手，只是从没上过任何课程。）

举一些例子,  be of + 抽象名词 结构 ，等价于 be + 对应形容词
“be of + 抽象名词”是英语中**正式且地道的表达结构**，核心作用是替代“be + 对应形容词”，让语言更简洁、书面化，广泛用于商务、学术、职场等正式场景。以下按**高频程度+场景分类**整理典型例子，每例均包含“原结构+等价形容词结构+中英双语例句”，方便直接套用：
一、通用高频基础款（日常/正式场景都适用）

| be of + 抽象名词 | 等价 be + 形容词 | 英文例句 | 中文翻译 |
|------------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| be of assistance | be helpful（有帮助的） | We are always of assistance to new employees. | 我们始终愿意为新员工提供帮助。 |
| be of importance | be important（重要的） | This meeting is of great importance. | 这次会议至关重要。 |
| be of value | be valuable（有价值的） | Your feedback is of great value to us. | 你的反馈对我们极具价值。 |
| be of use | be useful（有用的） | This tool is of little use in daily work. | 这个工具在日常工作中没什么用处。 |
| be of interest | be interesting（有趣的） | The report is of particular interest to the team. | 这份报告让团队特别感兴趣。 |

二、职场/商务进阶款（正式沟通、邮件、报告常用）
| be of + 抽象名词 | 等价 be + 形容词 | 英文例句 | 中文翻译 |
|------------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| be of benefit | be beneficial（有益的） | This policy is of benefit to all employees. | 这项政策对所有员工都有益。 |
| be of significance | be significant（有重大意义的） | The cooperation is of great significance for both companies. | 此次合作对双方公司都意义重大。 |
| be of relevance | be relevant（相关的） | This data is of no relevance to the project. | 这些数据与该项目无关。 |
| be of urgency | be urgent（紧急的） | The matter is of extreme urgency. | 这件事极其紧急。 |
| be of reliability | be reliable（可靠的） | This supplier is of high reliability. | 这家供应商的可靠性很高。 |

三、学术/专业场景款（论文、技术文档常用）
| be of + 抽象名词 | 等价 be + 形容词 | 英文例句 | 中文翻译 |
|------------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| be of validity | be valid（有效的） | The research method is of strong validity. | 该研究方法具有很强的有效性。 |
| be of accuracy | be accurate（准确的） | The test result is of high accuracy. | 测试结果的准确度很高。 |
| be of consistency | be consistent（一致的） | The experimental data is of good consistency. | 实验数据具有良好的一致性。 |
| be of complexity | be complex（复杂的） | This system is of considerable complexity. | 这个系统具有相当高的复杂性。 |

四、结构使用关键注意事项
1.  **修饰程度**：常搭配 `great/ little/ much/ particular/ extreme` 等词，强化语气，如“of great importance”（至关重要）、“of little use”（用处不大），比直接用“very important”“not very useful”更正式；
2.  **抽象名词属性**：此处的抽象名词多为**不可数名词**，无复数形式，如 assistance/ importance/ value，不能写成“be of assistances”；
3.  **场景适配**：日常口语中可优先用形容词（如“Your advice is helpful”），而正式书面语中用“be of + 抽象名词”（如“Your advice is of great help”）更显专业。
