To many outsiders, the Sahara may seem the very definition of desolate.

But it is not all sand and dunes.

National Geographic writer Don Webster and photographer George Thymetz have come to northern Chad to explore the central Sahara.

Heading deep into the desert, they come across the Enedi Plateau sandstone ridges at the edge of the central Sahara.

The team is looking for an ancient crossroad where nomads have crossed paths.

Since this area was wetter, greener and flush with game thousands of years ago, the austere landscape is timeless and very much alive.

George is drawn deeper into the canyon by the sound of bellowing camels.

It's a world class beautiful place and all the camels are coming in.

You can hear their voices echoing off the walls.

It's kind of like being in a cathedral.

This is the Ghelta Arche, a rock pool visited by the ancients.

Gheltas are like highway rest stops for those who travel the desert.

Here they can fill their goatskins with water, swap news and rest their animals.

This wind scoured canyon catches and holds rainfall like a barrel.

This precious desert commodity is well used.

They never really tell you about having to walk through the water that's black with the dung of 10,000 camels.

The dark water also harbors danger.

There are crocodiles here, a vestige of a wetter time.

This is very strange seeing these prehistoric creatures that are, are trapped there like they're stuck on a little desert island, if you will.

In the desert, the islands are the water and they just got trapped there by the tide.

In the upper reaches of the canyon, George gets a surprise cave art from thousands of years ago.

For the team, Gilta Arche is an amazing discovery of life thriving in one of the harshest environments on earth.
