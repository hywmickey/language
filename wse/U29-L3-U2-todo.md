Let's go talk to the team's radio announcer to find out the details.
I have been doing Maryland football and basketball for 28 years.
I broadcast, I describe what I'm seeing on the radio.
I'm the eyes and the ears of the people who can't get here. 
Only 50,000 people can get in this stadium to watch this football game.
stadium: 体育场
So no matter where you are, you can listen to the game.
I think the game dictates the broadcase.
我认为比赛内容决定了转播（的走向 / 内容）。
dictate：支配、决定
	“dictate the terms（定条件）”“dictate the pace（掌控节奏）”。
	The market usually dictates the price of raw materials.（市场通常决定原材料的价格。）
	The quality of the script dictates how successful the movie will be.（剧本质量决定了这部电影会有多成功。）
When you have an exciting game, there's an exciting broadcast.


The radio announcer described each play of the big game!
We could hear the sound of the crowd cheering on the radio.
我们能在收音机里听到人群欢呼的声音。
cheer:欢呼、喝彩，常见搭配 “cheer sb. on”（为某人加油）、“cheer for sth.”（为某事欢呼）。
    例句 1：The fans cheered loudly as the team scored a goal.（球队进球时，球迷们大声欢呼。）
    例句 2：We all cheered her on when she ran the marathon.（她跑马拉松时，我们都为她加油。）
What time will they broadcast the big game tonight?
Usually, the announcer sits in a booth which is called the press box.
通常，解说员会坐在一个名为 “新闻播报席” 的隔间里。
booth：指 “（用于特定用途的）小隔间、小亭子”，常见搭配有 “phone booth”（电话亭）、“ticket booth”（售票亭）
press box：新闻播报席；记者席
	Reporters and announcers gathered in the press box to cover the game.（记者和解说员聚集在新闻播报席报道这场比赛。）
The game is broadcast all over the world.
The game dicates how exciting the actual broadcast will be.
比赛本身决定了实际转播会有多精彩。
I like this announcer. He always describes the smallest details.
