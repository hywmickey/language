Let's go talk to the team's radio announcer to find out the details.
I have been doing Maryland football and basketball for 28 years.
I broadcast, I describe what I'm seeing on the radio.
I'm the eyes and the ears of the people who can't get here. 
Only 50,000 people can get in this stadium to watch this football game.
stadium: 体育场
So no matter where you are, you can listen to the game.
I think the game dictates the broadcast.
我认为比赛内容决定了转播（的走向 / 内容）。
dictate：支配、决定
	“dictate the terms（定条件）”“dictate the pace（掌控节奏）”。
	The market usually dictates the price of raw materials.（市场通常决定原材料的价格。）
	The quality of the script dictates how successful the movie will be.（剧本质量决定了这部电影会有多成功。）
When you have an exciting game, there's an exciting broadcast.

The radio announcer described each play of the big game!
We could hear the sound of the crowd cheering on the radio.
我们能在收音机里听到人群欢呼的声音。
cheer:欢呼、喝彩，常见搭配 “cheer sb. on”（为某人加油）、“cheer for sth.”（为某事欢呼）。
    例句 1：The fans cheered loudly as the team scored a goal.（球队进球时，球迷们大声欢呼。）
    例句 2：We all cheered her on when she ran the marathon.（她跑马拉松时，我们都为她加油。）
What time will they broadcast the big game tonight?
Usually, the announcer sits in a booth which is called the press box.
通常，解说员会坐在一个名为 “新闻播报席” 的隔间里。
booth：指 “（用于特定用途的）小隔间、小亭子”，常见搭配有 “phone booth”（电话亭）、“ticket booth”（售票亭）
press box：新闻播报席；记者席
	Reporters and announcers gathered in the press box to cover the game.（记者和解说员聚集在新闻播报席报道这场比赛。）
The game is broadcast all over the world.
The game dicates how exciting the actual broadcast will be.

I like this announcer. He always describes the smallest details.

Devin can__ throw, he gets inside the 10-yard line.
德文能传球，他还能带球冲到 10 码线内。
    gets inside the 10-yard line：“10-yard line”（10 码线）是美式足球场地的关键标记（场地以码为单位，10 码线通常靠近对方端区，是得分的关键区域），“gets inside” 译为 “冲到…… 内”，体现球员通过奔跑或战术配合主动进入关键区域的动态感，准确传递 “向得分区推进” 的竞技意图。
Can you explain the game of football and tell us how it's played?
The object of the 11 guys is to move the ball as best they can, and to get in position to score as many points as they can.
这 11 个人的目标是尽全力推进球，并抢占位置以尽可能多得分数。
    The object of...：此处表示 “…… 的目标 / 目的”，日常也可替换为 “the goal of...” 或 “the aim of...”
    get in position：“抢占位置”，强调通过跑位、战术配合等主动行动占据有利的比赛位置，体现竞技运动的主动性。
    as best they can / as many points as they can：均为 “尽某人所能” 的结构，前者修饰动作 “推进球”
You're right there in the press box, looking down at kids tackling, running, throwing.
你就在记者席上，低头看着孩子们（在场上）冲撞、奔跑、传球。
tackling：在运动语境中（尤其美式足球、橄榄球），指 “擒抱、冲撞”（阻止对方球员前进的动作）；若指足球，可译为 “铲球”，此处结合 “kids” 和 “running, throwing”，更可能是美式足球或校园球类运动，故优先译 “冲撞”。
