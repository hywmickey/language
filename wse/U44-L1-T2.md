MYSTERY KIDNAPPING OF MEXICAN MILLIONAIRE From our Latin American Correspondent
In a daring lightning attack yesterday afternoon, 59-year-old industrialist and factory owner Carlos Ramirez, one of Mexico's richest men, was kidnapped from his own luxury 17th-floor office in Mexico City.
The whole operation only lasted about 30 seconds, according to top computer executive and close friend of the family, Marco Benini, 28, who was the only person present, apart from Mr. Ramirez's personal clerk.
The elevator door suddently opened, and these four crazy women jumped out, shouting political slogans and shooting all over the place.
I tried to defend Mr. Ramirez by putting myself between him and them, but they pushed me out of the way, threatening to kill me if I spoke to the press about what I had seen, said Benini.
This morning, Mr. Ramirez's heartbroken family was trying to work out who might have been behind this dreadful crime.
And while Ramirez's daughter Juanita was on her way to Mexico to be with her mother, a colleague from our New York office interviewed the missing man's American son-in-law David Peters, 31, a leading linguist and translator.
I simply can't believe it's happened, he was like a father to me. I'd gladly sell every single thing I own to know that he was safe, at a time like this, who cares about money? said Peters.
At this stage we can only guess at the identify of those responsible, Ramirez had long-standing disagreement with the trade unions about the toilet arrangements at his factories.
Mexican polilce are also investigating a possible connection with last year's kidnapping of West German industrialist Werner Lembach, by a similar all-woman terrorist group.
By the way, no demand for the payment of money has so far been received, either by his relatives or by the police.

There is not much demand for these kinds of services.
His politics are a bit wrong, don't you think? He needs to figure out what the people want.

解析：You won't get away with this. Someone will find out what you did.

句子深度解析（语法+搭配+语境+拓展）
一、整体翻译（贴合语气的自然表达）
**直译**：你不会侥幸逃脱的。总会有人发现你做了什么。  
**地道译文**：这事你躲不掉的。迟早会有人查出你的所作所为。  
（注：译文强化了原句的警告/威胁语气，“躲不掉”“查出”更符合中文口语中对不良行为的告诫场景。）

二、逐句拆解（语法+核心结构）
1. 第一句：You won't get away with this.
- **句子结构**：主谓宾结构  
  - 主语：You（你）  
  - 谓语：won't get away with（不会侥幸逃脱/免受惩罚）  
  - 宾语：this（指代前文提到的“不良行为”，如作弊、撒谎、违法等）  
- **核心语法点**：  
  - 时态：一般将来时（won't = will not），表示对未来的预测（“不会发生某事”）。  
  - 关键短语：**get away with sth.**（核心搭配，必须掌握）  
    - 含义：侥幸逃脱（惩罚/责任）；做某事未被发现/未受惩罚。  
    - 结构特点：后接名词/代词（this/that/it）或动名词（doing sth.）。  

2. 第二句：Someone will find out what you did.
- **句子结构**：主句 + 宾语从句  
  - 主句：Someone will find out（有人会发现）  
    - 主语：Someone（某人，泛指“任何人”，无需特指）  
    - 谓语：will find out（会查明/发现）  
  - 宾语从句：what you did（你做了什么）  
    - 连接词：what（既引导从句，又在从句中作did的宾语）  
    - 语序：陈述语序（疑问词what + 主语you + 谓语did），符合宾语从句规则。  
    - 时态：从句用一般过去时（did），对应“过去发生的行为”，主句用一般将来时（will find out），表示“未来会发现过去的事”，时态逻辑一致。  

三、核心短语深度拓展（搭配+例句+辨析）
1. get away with sth./doing sth.（高频必考短语）
- **核心搭配**：  
  - 接名词：get away with theft（盗窃未受惩罚）、get away with lies（撒谎没被揭穿）

四、句式灵活替换（同义表达+语气调整）
1. 第一句（You won't get away with this.）的同义替换：
- 语气更强（威胁）：You'll never escape punishment for this.（这事你永远逃不掉惩罚。）  
- 口语化（日常警告）：This time you can't get away with it.（这次你躲不过去了。）  
- 正式场景（书面/法律）：You shall not evade liability for this act.（你不得为此行为逃避责任。）

2. 第二句（Someone will find out what you did.）的同义替换：
- 强调“迟早”：Sooner or later, people will uncover your actions.（迟早有人会揭露你的行为。）  
- 更书面化：It will be revealed what you have done.（你的所作所为终将被揭露。）  
- 口语化：Someone's gonna find out what you did.（会有人发现你干的好事的。）（gonna=going to，口语缩略）

五、语境应用场景（如何精准使用这句话）
- **适用场景**：用于发现他人的不良行为（如欺骗、违规、违法、伤害他人等），发出警告或预测其会受到惩罚。  
  - 例1：（发现同事挪用公款）You won't get away with this. The audit team will find out what you did.（这事你躲不掉的。审计组会查出你的所作所为。）  
  - 例2：（孩子撒谎被家长发现）Don't lie to me—you won't get away with this. Someone will find out the truth.（别跟我撒谎——你骗不了人。总会有人发现真相的。）  
- **语气注意**：原句语气坚定，带有警告意味，非正式和正式场景均可使用，但需根据关系调整语气（对陌生人/敌人用更强硬，对熟人/家人可稍缓和）。

六、语法易错点提醒
1. 宾语从句语序：what you did（正确）≠ what did you do（错误），宾语从句必须用陈述语序。  
2. get away with 后接动名词：get away with cheating（正确）≠ get away with cheat（错误）。  
3. someone 作主语时，谓语动词用单数：Someone will find out（正确）≠ Someone will finds out（错误）。

纠错： What  are you exactly referring to?

正确句子：What exactly are you referring to?

纠错解析（聚焦副词语序规则）
1. **错误核心**：副词 `exactly` 的位置不当  
   英语中，**疑问副词/程度副词**（如 exactly、really、actually、specifically 等）在特殊疑问句中的语序规则是：  
   → **疑问词 + 副词 + 助动词 + 主语 + 实义动词**  
   原句将 `exactly` 放在主语 `you` 之后，违反了这一语序习惯，导致表达不地道（语法无错，但不符合母语者使用逻辑）。

2. **规则拆解**：  
   - 特殊疑问句结构：疑问词（What/Who/Where 等）+ 助动词（are/is/do/can 等）+ 主语 + 实义动词  
   - 当有「程度/强调副词」时，副词需插入「疑问词」和「助动词」之后、「主语」之前，起到强调疑问焦点的作用（此处强调“具体指哪一个/哪件事”）。

3. **同类错误对比与修正**：  
   | 错误句子 | 正确句子 | 说明 |
   |---|---|---|
   | What are you really talking about? | What really are you talking about? | 副词 really 插入疑问词与助动词之间 |
   | Who are you actually waiting for? | Who actually are you waiting for? | 副词 actually 位置调整，强调“实际在等谁” |
   | Where are you specifically going? | Where specifically are you going? | 副词 specifically 突出“具体去向” |

场景化例句（强化语序应用）
1. 日常沟通：  
   - A: "You said there's a problem—what exactly are you referring to?"（你说有问题，具体指的是什么？）  
   - B: "The report you submitted yesterday—there are three typos on page 5."（你昨天提交的报告，第5页有三个错别字。）

2. 工作对接：  
   - "The client mentioned 'adjustments to the plan'—what exactly are they referring to?"（客户提到“调整方案”，他们具体指的是什么？）

3. 朋友聊天：  
   - "You kept talking about 'that interesting movie'—what exactly are you referring to? I want to watch it too!"（你一直说“那部好看的电影”，具体指哪部呀？我也想看！）

拓展：其他高频副词的相同语序规则
除了 `exactly`，以下副词在特殊疑问句中需遵循同样语序：  
- really（真正地）：What really are you looking for?（你真正在找的是什么？）  
- actually（实际上）：Who actually are you working with?（你实际上在和谁合作？）  
- specifically（具体地）：Which project specifically are you responsible for?（你具体负责哪个项目？）  
- precisely（精确地）：What precisely are the requirements?（具体要求是什么？）  

核心逻辑：这类副词用于「缩小疑问范围、强调具体性」，放在疑问词后、助动词前能让疑问焦点更清晰，符合英语母语者的表达习惯。
