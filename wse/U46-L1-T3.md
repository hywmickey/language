What kind of comparison does Baz make between his wife and Toni Moroni? He says that they both have beautiful voices?
What two jokes does Baz make about the way Kristi look? He jokes that the dress is too open in the front and that her hair is n__
Why is Baz surprised by Kristi's English? because it's so good.
What does Annie say she will do after she finishes watching the Baz Baxter show? She says that she will get a copy of the article and talk with a lawyer.
Why is Morris taking Bedges' place? Bedges is in the hospital.
What does Harry want to make sure Morris knows about his policy? that he treats all police officers the same.
What mistake did Roger make? He thought Theo Gusper had died.

What a lovely voice that guys's got!
Seriously though, I'm not married.I'm still open to offers.
不过说真的，我还没结婚呢，目前也还愿意接受别人的追求。
offers
    指 “感情上的追求、示好”，即 “愿意接受别人的追求、考虑发展恋爱关系”。
    若在商业场景（如求职、卖房），“open to offers” 才是 “愿意接受报价”（例：The company is open to offers for this project. 这家公司愿意接受这个项目的合作报价），但本句因 “not married”，明确指向感情场景。

Merdoch Towers 127 Fifth Avenue New York, N. Y.
I am writing to you to inform you that I have been requested by Ms. Annie Peters to act for her with regard to an article which appeared in your newspaper on Sunday, April 3rd this year.
My client believes that the article in question, which appeared under the title "From Terrorism to Drug Smuggling - the Secret Story of the Peters Family." by Kristi Schmidt, amounted to a personal attack on herself and on other member of her family.
She claims that the article contains several imporant errors of fact and gives the false impression that both she and her late father had been directly and personally involved in crimes of violence.
Accroding to my client, the article further suggests that her late father(whose tragic loss she still very much regrets) is still alive and in hiding from the authorities.
My client finally claims that the information on which the article in question is supposedly based was obtained under false pretenses, when Ms Schmidt pretended to be a sympathizer with Ms Peter's political views in order to make an appointment to speak with her.
My client intends to sue "The Sunday Post" newspaper for $250,000, including costs, as well as suing Ms. Schmidt herself. I need hardly point out the negative effect which this action will have, both on your own public image and on your newspaper's.
In view of this, should you wish to aviod such an unpleasant and time-wasting course of events, I am certain that my client would be prepared to reach an agreement with you out of court for something less than the figure stated above.
I await your replay and look forward to discussing any reasonable offers.
Yours, Carol N. Smudge.

We cannot wait until her soon-to-be movie is released.
我们不能等到她即将上映的电影上映。

It was on his suggestion that I decided to stay away from you.

解说一下:discriminated against

一、核心含义与本质  
“discriminated against” 是英语中表达“**受到歧视**”的固定动词短语，核心指向“因他人的性别、种族、年龄、宗教、性取向、残障等特征，而受到不公平、区别对待（通常是负面对待）”，强调“被区别对待的被动性与不公平性”。  

⚠️ 关键提醒：短语中的 **against 不可省略**——单独的 “discriminate” 本身是“区分、辨别”的中性含义（如 “discriminate between right and wrong” 区分对错），只有搭配 “against” 后，才具备“歧视”的负面语义。


二、详细拆解（词性、搭配、场景）  
1. 词性与结构  
- 基础构成：动词 “discriminate”（原形） + 介词 “against” → 被动形式 “be discriminated against”（最常用，表“被歧视”）  
- 常见时态：根据语境变化，核心结构不变  
  - 一般现在时：She is often discriminated against at work.（她在工作中常受到歧视。）  
  - 现在进行时：They feel they are being discriminated against.（他们觉得自己正在受到歧视。）  
  - 现在完成时：He has been discriminated against because of his disability for years.（多年来，他因残障一直受到歧视。）  


2. 高频搭配（“歧视的维度+场景”）  
“discriminated against” 后常接 “because of/on account of” 引出“歧视的原因”，或接 “in” 引出“歧视发生的场景”，覆盖生活、职场、教育等核心领域：  

| 搭配类型       | 结构示例                  | 中文释义                  | 场景说明                          |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 表“歧视原因”   | be discriminated against **because of** sth | 因某事受到歧视            | 后接“身份特征”（性别、种族等）    |
| 表“歧视场景”   | be discriminated against **in** sth       | 在某方面受到歧视          | 后接“场景”（职场、教育、住房等）  |

**场景化例句**（覆盖常见歧视维度）：  
- 性别歧视：Women were once widely discriminated against in voting rights.（女性曾在投票权方面受到广泛歧视。）  
- 种族歧视：Many people of color have been discriminated against because of their skin color.（许多有色人种因肤色受到歧视。）  
- 年龄歧视：Older job seekers are often discriminated against in the recruitment process.（年长的求职者在招聘过程中常受到歧视。）  
- 性取向歧视：LGBTQ+ individuals should not be discriminated against in any aspect of life.（LGBTQ+群体不应在生活的任何方面受到歧视。）  


3. 易错点与辨析（避免误用）  
- ❶ 不可省略 “against”：  
  错误：She felt discriminated because of her gender.（缺少 “against”，语义不完整，“discriminated” 无法表“歧视”）  
  正确：She felt discriminated **against** because of her gender.  
- ❷ 区分 “discriminate” 的两种核心含义：  
  很多人会混淆 “discriminate” 的“中性区分”与“负面歧视”义，需通过搭配判断：  

| 含义类型       | 搭配结构                  | 语义                  | 例句                          |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 中性（区分）   | discriminate **between** A and B | 区分A和B（无负面）    | We need to discriminate between facts and opinions.（我们需要区分事实和观点。） |
| 负面（歧视）   | discriminate **against** sb/sth | 歧视某人/某事（负面） | Employers must not discriminate against pregnant women.（雇主不得歧视孕妇。） |


三、使用语境与语气  
“discriminated against” 可用于**口语对话**（如向他人倾诉“自己受歧视的经历”）和**书面表达**（如新闻报道、法律文件、平等议题文章），语气客观但隐含“对不公平现象的否定”，例如：  
- 口语：“I really feel discriminated against at school just because I wear glasses.”（我觉得在学校就因为戴眼镜，自己总受歧视。）  
- 书面：“The law explicitly states that no one shall be discriminated against on the basis of religion.”（法律明确规定，任何人不得因宗教信仰受到歧视。）  

其核心语境始终围绕“**平等与公平**”，是讨论性别平等、种族平权、残障包容等社会议题时的核心短语。

为什么 “the other day”不加介词？

要理解 “the other day” 为什么不加介词，核心是明确它的 **语法属性、固定用法** 以及英语中“时间状语短语”的介词使用规则——简单来说，它是一类“自带时间语义、可直接作状语”的 **固定零介词时间短语**，无需额外介词（如 in/on/at）辅助。

一、先明确 “the other day” 的本质：固定时间状语短语
“the other day” 不是普通的“名词+名词”组合，而是英语中 **约定俗成的固定表达**，核心功能是 **直接作时间状语**（修饰动作发生的时间），含义是“前几天”（指过去几天内的某个不确定时间，非具体某一天）。  

它的语法属性和我们熟悉的 “yesterday”（昨天）、“today”（今天）、“tomorrow”（明天）完全一致——这些词/短语本身就是“时间状语”，无需加介词。比如：  
- 正确：I saw her **yesterday**.（我昨天见到她了。）  
- 正确：I met him **the other day**.（我前几天见到他了。）  
- 错误：I saw her **on yesterday**. / I met him **in the other day**.  


二、为什么不能加介词？从“介词的使用逻辑”拆解
英语中，时间类介词（in/on/at）的核心作用是 **“连接时间名词与句子，明确时间维度”**，但只适用于“需要补充维度”的时间表达。而 “the other day” 已自带“时间维度”，加介词会破坏语法逻辑，具体看以下对比：

| 介词       | 适用场景（需满足的条件）                | 能否用于 “the other day”？ | 错误原因解析                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **on**     | 用于“具体某一天”（如日期、星期）        | ❌ 不能                    | “the other day” 是“过去几天内的某个时间段”，不是“具体某一天”（如 on Monday/on June 1st），加 “on” 不符合“具体日期”的用法逻辑。 |
| **in**     | 用于“较长时间范围”（如年、月、季节、上午/下午） | ❌ 不能                    | “in” 修饰的是“持续一段时间的范围”（如 in 2024/in July），而 “the other day” 是“已发生的短期时间点”，且本身是固定短语，加 “in” 语义矛盾。 |
| **at**     | 用于“具体时间点”（如几点几分、黎明/黄昏） | ❌ 不能                    | “at” 修饰“精确到分钟/时刻的时间点”（如 at 3 PM/at dawn），“the other day” 是“几天内的模糊时间”，不符合“精确时间点”的用法。 |


三、同类“零介词时间短语”：举一反三理解规律
“the other day” 不是个例，英语中有一批 **“直接作时间状语、不加介词”的固定短语**，它们的共同特点是“语义完整、约定俗成，无需介词补充维度”。常见例子：  
1. **the day before yesterday**（前天）：I called her the day before yesterday.（我前天给她打了电话。）  
2. **the next day**（第二天，指过去或未来的“次日”）：He arrived and left the next day.（他到了，第二天就走了。）  
3. **one day**（某一天，可指过去或未来）：One day we’ll travel around the world.（总有一天我们会环游世界。）  
4. **some day**（将来某一天）：I hope to meet you some day.（我希望将来某天能见到你。）  

这些短语和 “the other day” 一样，都是“零介词时间状语”——只要记住：**若时间表达是“固定短语且自带‘过去/未来/模糊时间’语义”，通常无需加介词**。


四、总结：核心原因一句话概括
“the other day” 不加介词，是因为它是 **英语中约定俗成的“固定零介词时间状语短语”**：本身已明确“过去几天内”的时间语义，可直接修饰句子动作，无需 in/on/at 等介词“连接时间与句子”；加介词反而会违背“介词的使用场景”（如 on 接具体日期、in 接长时间范围），导致语法错误。

举例：It is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who...

以下是 **“It is/was + 被强调部分 + that/who...”** 强调句的全面示例，覆盖“强调主语、宾语、状语（时间/地点/原因）”等核心场景，同时区分“现在时（It is）”和“过去时（It was）”，每个例子均包含“原句+强调句+结构解析”，帮你清晰理解变形逻辑：

一、强调“主语”（人/物）
被强调部分是句子的动作发出者，强调人时可用 **who** 或 **that**，强调物时只能用 **that**。

| 场景       | 原句（非强调句）                | 强调句（It is/was...）                          | 结构解析                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 强调“人（主语）”（过去时） | Tom helped me with my homework last night.（汤姆昨晚帮我辅导了作业。） | **It was Tom who/that helped me with my homework last night.**（正是汤姆昨晚帮我辅导了作业。） | 被强调部分：Tom（主语，人）；用who/that均可，过去时用It was，去掉框架后原句完整。 |
| 强调“物（主语）”（现在时） | The new policy has improved people’s lives.（新政策改善了人们的生活。） | **It is the new policy that has improved people’s lives.**（正是新政策改善了人们的生活。） | 被强调部分：The new policy（主语，物）；只能用that，现在时用It is。 |

二、强调“宾语”（人/物）
被强调部分是句子的动作承受者，强调人时可用 **whom**（正式）、**who**（口语）或 **that**，强调物时只能用 **that**。

| 场景       | 原句（非强调句）                | 强调句（It is/was...）                          | 结构解析                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 强调“人（宾语）”（过去时） | I met Mary at the airport yesterday.（我昨天在机场见到了玛丽。） | **It was Mary whom/who/that I met at the airport yesterday.**（我昨天在机场见到的正是玛丽。） | 被强调部分：Mary（宾语，人）；正式用whom，口语用who/that，过去时用It was。 |
| 强调“物（宾语）”（现在时） | She bought a new laptop last week.（她上周买了一台新笔记本电脑。） | **It is a new laptop that she bought last week.**（她上周买的正是一台新笔记本电脑。） | 被强调部分：a new laptop（宾语，物）；只能用that，现在时用It is。 |
| 强调“复数宾语（物）”（过去时） | We collected old books for the children.（我们为孩子们收集了旧书。） | **It was old books that we collected for the children.**（我们为孩子们收集的正是旧书。） | 被强调部分：old books（复数宾语，物）；只能用that，过去时用It was。 |


三、强调“状语”（时间/地点/原因）
被强调部分是修饰动作的“时间、地点、原因”，**无论哪种状语，均只能用that**（不可用when/where/why）。

1. 强调“时间状语”

| 原句（非强调句）                | 强调句（It is/was...）                          | 结构解析                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| He will come back next Monday.（他下周一回来。） | **It is next Monday that he will come back.**（他正是要在下周一回来。） | 被强调部分：next Monday（时间状语，将来时，用It is）；只能用that，不可用when。 |
| They finished the project in 2023.（他们在2023年完成了项目。） | **It was in 2023 that they finished the project.**（他们正是在2023年完成了项目。） | 被强调部分：in 2023（时间状语，过去时，用It was）；只能用that。 |

2. 强调“地点状语”

| 原句（非强调句）                | 强调句（It is/was...）                          | 结构解析                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| We had dinner at that restaurant.（我们在那家餐厅吃的晚饭。） | **It was at that restaurant that we had dinner.**（我们正是在那家餐厅吃的晚饭。） | 被强调部分：at that restaurant（地点状语，过去时）；只能用that，不可用where。 |
| The meeting will be held in the conference room.（会议将在会议室举行。） | **It is in the conference room that the meeting will be held.**（会议正是要在会议室举行。） | 被强调部分：in the conference room（地点状语，将来时）；只能用that。 |

3. 强调“原因状语”（多与because搭配）
   
| 原句（非强调句）                | 强调句（It is/was...）                          | 结构解析                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| She cried because she lost her phone.（她哭是因为丢了手机。） | **It was because she lost her phone that she cried.**（她哭正是因为丢了手机。） | 被强调部分：because she lost her phone（原因状语，过去时）；只能用that，不可用why。 |
| He works hard because he wants to support his family.（他努力工作是因为想养家。） | **It is because he wants to support his family that he works hard.**（他努力工作正是因为想养家。） | 被强调部分：because he wants to support his family（原因状语，现在时）；只能用that。 |


四、强调句的关键注意事项（避坑指南）
1. **验证方法**：去掉“It is/was...that/who”后，剩余部分必须能构成完整句子（语法正确、语义通顺），否则不是强调句。  
   - 正确示例：It was Tom who helped me. → Tom helped me.（完整）；  
   - 错误示例：It was the park where we met. → The park we met.（不完整，这是定语从句，需改为It was in the park that we met.）。  
2. **连接词选择**：  
   - 强调“人（主语/宾语）”：可用who（主语）、whom（宾语，正式）、that；  
   - 强调“物、时间、地点、原因”：只能用that（不可用which/when/where/why）。  
3. **时态一致**：强调“过去的动作”用“It was”，强调“现在/将来的动作”用“It is”，与原句时态匹配。  
4. **主谓一致**：被强调部分是单数时，后续动词用单数；复数则用复数（如It was they who were late.）。

举例说明“deserve” 表达 “应得”


要理解 “deserve” 表达“应得”的核心逻辑，需结合其 **“基于主语的行为、付出或品质，理应获得对应结果（正面/负面）”** 的本质，以下按“搭配类型+场景”分类举例，覆盖日常、职场、学习、社会等高频语境，每个例子均含“英文原句+中文翻译+场景解析”，清晰呈现“应得”的逻辑关联：


一、deserve + 名词（直接接“应得的事物”，正面/负面均可）
“名词”直接体现“应得的具体对象”，逻辑是“主语的行为/品质 → 匹配对应的事物”。

| 英文原句 | 中文翻译 | 场景解析（“应得”的逻辑） |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| She works 12 hours a day and deserves a promotion. | 她每天工作12小时，理应获得晋升。 | 正面场景（职场）：“长期高强度工作”（付出）→ “晋升”（应得的回报），体现“付出与回报匹配”。 |
| The honest student deserves respect from everyone. | 这个诚实的学生理应得到所有人的尊重。 | 正面场景（校园/人际）：“诚实”（优秀品质）→ “尊重”（应得的认可），体现“品质与认可匹配”。 |
| He lied to his parents many times and deserves criticism. | 他多次对父母撒谎，理应受到批评。 | 负面场景（家庭）：“多次撒谎”（错误行为）→ “批评”（应得的负面结果），体现“行为与惩罚匹配”。 |
| The team won the championship fair and square—they deserve the trophy. | 这支队伍光明正大地赢得了冠军，他们理应获得奖杯。 | 正面场景（竞技）：“公平竞争且夺冠”（成果）→ “奖杯”（应得的荣誉），体现“成果与奖励匹配”。 |


二、deserve + 不定式（to do，分“主动表主动”和“被动表被动”）
1. 主动表主动（主语是“应得结果的主动获得者”，结果为正面）
逻辑：“主语主动付出/具备品质 → 主动获得正面结果”。

| 英文原句 | 中文翻译 | 场景解析 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| He practiced the piano for 5 years—he deserves to win the competition. | 他练了5年钢琴，理应赢得这场比赛。 | 正面场景（艺术竞技）：“长期练习”（主动付出）→ “赢得比赛”（主动获得的正面结果），“to win” 是主语“他”主动完成的动作。 |
| They helped the community rebuild after the disaster—they deserve to be praised. | 他们在灾后帮助社区重建，理应受到表扬。 | 正面场景（社会公益）：“帮助重建”（主动行善）→ “被表扬”（被动获得的正面认可），“to be praised” 是主语“他们”被动接受的正面结果（此处“被动”仍属正面，因“表扬”是积极评价）。 |
| She studied day and night for the exam—she deserves to get a good grade. | 她为考试日夜学习，理应取得好成绩。 | 正面场景（学习）：“日夜学习”（主动努力）→ “取得好成绩”（主动获得的学习成果），“to get a good grade” 是主语“她”主动达成的目标。 |

2. 被动表被动（主语是“应得结果的承受者”，结果多为负面）
逻辑：“主语做出错误/违法行为 → 被动承受负面结果（惩罚、制裁等）”。

| 英文原句 | 中文翻译 | 场景解析 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| The thief stole a lot of money—he deserves to be arrested. | 这个小偷偷了很多钱，理应被逮捕。 | 负面场景（法律）：“偷窃”（违法行为）→ “被逮捕”（被动接受的法律制裁），“to be arrested” 是主语“小偷”被动承受的负面结果。 |
| He broke his promise to his friend again—he deserves to be ignored. | 他又一次违背了对朋友的承诺，理应被忽视。 | 负面场景（人际）：“屡次失信”（错误行为）→ “被忽视”（被动接受的人际反馈），“to be ignored” 是主语“他”因行为不当应得的负面对待。 |
| The company cheated its customers—they deserve to be punished by the law. | 这家公司欺骗消费者，理应受到法律惩罚。 | 负面场景（商业/法律）：“欺骗消费者”（违法经营）→ “被法律惩罚”（被动接受的法律后果），“to be punished” 体现“行为违法→应得制裁”的逻辑。 |


三、deserve + 动名词（doing，主动表被动，仅用于负面结果）
这是“deserve”的特殊用法：**动名词用主动形式，但表达被动含义**，语气比“deserve to be done”更强烈，核心逻辑是“主语的行为极其不当，完全配得上负面结果”。

| 英文原句 | 中文翻译 | 场景解析（主动表被动的逻辑） |
|----------|----------|------------------------------|
| He bullied his classmates for years—he deserves punishing. | 他欺负同学多年，完全活该受惩罚。 | 负面场景（校园霸凌）：“deserves punishing” = “deserves to be punished”（主动表被动），语气更强烈，强调“欺负行为恶劣，受惩罚是必然且应得的”。 |
| The politician lied to the public—he deserves criticizing. | 这位政客向公众撒谎，理应受到批评。 | 负面场景（政治/社会）：“deserves criticizing” = “deserves to be criticized”，用主动形式强化“撒谎行为不可容忍，批评是应得的”的态度。 |
| They damaged the public park on purpose—they deserve fining. | 他们故意破坏公园，理应被罚款。 | 负面场景（公共秩序）：“deserves fining” = “deserves to be fined”，简洁表达“故意破坏→应得罚款”，主动形式让语气更直接。 |


四、用法总结（帮你避免误用）
1. **核心逻辑不变**：无论搭配名词、不定式还是动名词，“deserve” 始终围绕“**主语的行为/品质 → 匹配对应的结果（正面/负面）**”，不存在“无理由的应得”。  
2. **搭配规则**：  
   - 正面结果：常用 “deserve + 名词（respect/reward）” 或 “deserve to do（win/succeed）”；  
   - 负面结果：常用 “deserve + 名词（criticism/punishment）”、“deserve to be done（arrested/punished）” 或 “deserve doing（punishing/criticizing，主动表被动）”；  
3. **常见错误**：  
   - 错误：*She deserves get a reward.*（缺少不定式符号“to”，正确：deserves to get）；  
   - 错误：*He deserves punish.*（需用被动：deserves to be punished 或 deserves punishing）。

纠错： They deserve  getting arrested after what they have done.

一、纠错结果  
**正确句子（两种常用形式）**：  

1. They deserve **arresting** after what they have done.  
2. They deserve **to get arrested** after what they have done.  


二、错误原因解析  
原句错误在于 **“deserve” 的动名词搭配误用**——多余了 “getting”，违背了“deserve + 动名词”的固定语法规则：  

核心规则回顾：“deserve” 表“应受（负面结果）”的动名词搭配  
“deserve” 后接动名词（doing）时，**直接用动词的原形动名词形式，且“主动表被动”**（无需加 “getting”“being” 等额外词），含义等同于 “deserve to be done”（不定式+被动）。  
- 逻辑本质：“deserve arresting” 本身就隐含“应被逮捕”的被动含义（主动形式表被动），再加 “getting” 会造成语法冗余（“deserve getting arrested” 相当于重复表达“应被逮捕”，不符合搭配习惯）。  
- 对比错误与正确：  
  - 错误：*deserve getting arrested*（多余 “getting”，搭配冗余）；  
  - 正确：deserve **arresting**（主动表被动，= deserve to be arrested）；  
  - 正确：deserve **to get arrested**（不定式+被动结构，“get arrested” 是口语化被动表达，无需省略“to”）。  


三、正确句子的语义与场景适配  
两种正确形式语义完全一致（均表“他们做了这样的事，理应被逮捕”），仅语体略有差异：  

| 正确句子                | 语义侧重点                  | 适用场景                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| They deserve arresting... | 更简洁，偏书面/正式         | 用于新闻报道、法律评论等稍正式的语境，如：*The criminals deserve arresting for their violent acts.*（这些罪犯因暴力行为理应被逮捕。） |
| They deserve to get arrested... | 更口语化，强调“结果的被动性” | 用于日常对话、非正式讨论，如：*After stealing the car, they definitely deserve to get arrested.*（偷了车之后，他们绝对理应被逮捕。） |


四、同类搭配拓展（避免同类错误）  
掌握“deserve + 动名词（主动表被动）”的核心逻辑，可举一反三应用于其他负面结果场景：  
- 错误：*He deserves getting punished.* → 正确：He deserves **punishing** / He deserves **to get punished**（他理应受惩罚）；  
- 错误：*The liar deserves getting criticized.* → 正确：The liar deserves **criticizing** / The liar deserves **to get criticized**（这个说谎者理应受批评）；  
- 错误：*They deserve getting fined.* → 正确：They deserve **fining** / They deserve **to get fined**（他们理应被罚款）。  

核心总结：“deserve” 后接动名词时，直接用动词原形的-ing形式（如arresting/punishing），无需加“getting”；若想更口语化，用“deserve to get + 过去分词”（如to get arrested）也完全正确。
