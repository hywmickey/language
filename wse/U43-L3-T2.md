ROBERT PEARY

The North Pole has long fascinated people around the globe. Even though many like to believe it is the home of Santa Claus, imagining a rather jovial and elderly Santa and Mrs. Claus with their elves and reindeer, the fact is that there is not much there. However, this has not stopped people from wanting to go to the North Pole. One of the most adamant explorers with the desire to go to the North Pole was American Navy engineer, Robert Peary.

Robert Peary loved the cold, and the area north of Canada intrigued him.Making his way through the Greenland icecap in 1886, Robert Peary, on vacation from his job at the Navy, decided that the North Pole lay beyond Greenland rather than being a part of it. After many expeditions into Greenland, Peary decided that he would be the first person reach the top of the world known as the North Pole.

Peary was able to arrange a leave from the Navy so that he could explore the Arctic. It was on one of his shopping expeditions for supplies for one of his polar journys that Peary met African American Navy civil engineer Matthew Henson. Peary hired him as a valet, but knew that Henson's skills and knowledge would be an asset to him in his trek to the North Pole, and it was he whom Henson chose to accompany him on his journey.

In preparing for his trek to the North Pole, Peary studied how the Eskimos lived. However, it was Henson who was able to create a special relationship with the Eskimos, even speaking their language, to learn about their ways. With the knowledge they had gained from their studies of Eskimos, Peary and Henson learned how to drive dog sleds, build igloos, and use furs. After years of preparation, in the late winter of 1909, Peary and Henson started their journey form Canada's Ellesmere Island, hoping to take advantage of the colder winter weather which would keep the ice solid and easier for travel. The two men took the first steps of their journey with a support team of 22 men, 130 dogs, and 19 sleds.

It was not until April 6,1909 that Peary and Henson were able to reach the North Pole and plant the American flag. By the time they had reached their destination, Peary and Henson had left their support team behind, and there were only six men left: Peary, Henson, Oatah, Egingwah, Seegloo, and Olkeah (the last four were Eskimos). Peary had claimed victory, the first to reach the North Pole. However, when he returned to civilization, he found out that another American, Frederick Cook, had claimed to have reached the North Pole an entire year before him. It was not until later that it was discovered that Cook's evidence of his expedition was fake, and that, in fact, the photos that were taken, supposedly at the North Pole, were actually several miles short of it. After a study of the matter in 1911, the United States Congress decided that Peary and his crew were definitely the first to reach the North Pole.

Robert Peary died in 1920 at the age of 63 while Henson lived to reach the age of 88. Like Peary, Henson's North Pole expedition was not without its controversy. Many people did not want to credit his part in the expedition due to his race, but eventually he was credited for his contribution to the expedition. He was later than a member of the Explorer's Club, and after his death, his grave was moved to Arlington National Cemetery. As a final honor to Peary s partner, the National Geographic Society awarded Henson its highest award in the year 2000, the Hubbard Medal for distinction in exploration, discovery and research. Fittingly, this was the same award that his friend Robert Peary had recieved in 1906.
