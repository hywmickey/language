区分 “move on to” 和 “move onto” 的不同用法。

1. **固定短语结构**：“move on” 是固定短语，意为 “继续前进、转入下一个话题 / 事项”，其中 “on” 是副词，而非介词。当需要接 “转入的对象”（如本句中的 “your best known case”）时，必须加介词 “to” 来连接宾语，形成 “move on to + 宾语” 的结构，表达 “继续讨论 / 进入到……”。
2. **“onto” 的用法限制**：“onto” 是一个介词，核心含义是 “到…… 之上”，强调**位置的转移**，例如 “Move onto the next page.”（翻到下一页）、“The cat jumped onto the table.”（猫跳到桌子上）。本句语境是 “转入下一个案例”，并非位置移动，因此不能用 “onto”。
