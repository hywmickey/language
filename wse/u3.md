区分 “move on to” 和 “move onto” 的不同用法。

1. **固定短语结构**：“move on” 是固定短语，意为 “继续前进、转入下一个话题 / 事项”，其中 “on” 是副词，而非介词。当需要接 “转入的对象”（如本句中的 “your best known case”）时，必须加介词 “to” 来连接宾语，形成 “move on to + 宾语” 的结构，表达 “继续讨论 / 进入到……”。
2. **“onto” 的用法限制**：“onto” 是一个介词，核心含义是 “到…… 之上”，强调**位置的转移**，例如 “Move onto the next page.”（翻到下一页）、“The cat jumped onto the table.”（猫跳到桌子上）。本句语境是 “转入下一个案例”，并非位置移动，因此不能用 “onto”。

Down with Plastic Box Corp.!
打倒塑料盒公司。！
Good evening everyone. Here are the headlines for today, Monday November 25th.
There's been more trouble at the New York City headquarters of the Plastic Box Corporation, where a demonstration by environmentalists has now been going on for nearly six months.
Fighting broke out between demonstrators and the police during a meeting outside the factory, and serveral people were injured, including two policemen.
The speaker at the meeting, Ms. Annie Peters, was arrested and taken to the police department for questioning.
Ms. Peters, you may remember, is the daughter of the well-known drugs baron Hugo Peters, who died four years ago. Ms. Peters was later allowed to go free, when we managed to catch up with her.
"I'll tell you why I was arrested: It's because the police, together with the newspapers and the TV companies, want to put an end to our demonstration."
"And that's because they're all supporting the Plastic Box Corporation in its war against the planet."
Anyway, the demostration is still going on, and it seems to have had some effect. Tomorrow, Barbara Bolton, the Environment Secretary, will be haveing a meeting with the  directors of the Plastic Box Company.

David doesn't support Annie in the demonstrations.
Annie was arrested at the demostration.
She is a feminist. She wants women to get the same money and jobs as men.
The demonstration has had an effect on local politics.
There will be lots of different speakers, but the principal speaker will be David.
将会有许多不同的发言者，但主要发言者将是戴维。
The Plastic Box Company is represented by an international law firm.
塑料盒公司由一家国际律师事务所代理。
She's an environmentalist. She wants to ensure that nature survives.
她是一位环保主义者。她希望确保大自然得以存续。
I'm not sure what his political view are, but he seems to be more left of center.
我不确定他的政治观点是什么，但他似乎更偏向左翼。
