There's no elevator here.
You're going to have to go up the stairs.
I guess I should have left the boxes at the bottom.

I seem to have lost my bit of paper.
我好像把我的那张纸条弄丢了。
seem to have done：似乎 / 好像已经做了某事，强调说话人对过去动作的不确定推测；区别于 seem to do（现在似乎做某事）。
例句：She seems to have missed the bus. （她好像没赶上公交车。）
a bit of / my bit of ： 此处 my bit of paper 不是字面 “一点纸”，而是口语中特指 “一张小小的纸片 / 纸条”，隐含 “不重要但自己需要的小物件” 的意味；区别于：
a piece of paper：泛指 “一张纸”（无大小暗示）；
a scrap of paper：强调 “碎纸片”（更零碎）。
搭配：a bit of cloth（一小块布）；my bit of bread（我的那一小块面包）

Guess I should have put it in my pants pocket.
I shouldn't have given her all that money.

It might have been something to do with the demonstration against that pharmaceutical company.
这可能与反对那家制药公司的示威活动有关。
