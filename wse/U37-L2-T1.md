Why does Juanita keeping make David leave the room? She doesn't want him to talk about his family.

Would you been so kind__ to give her a message?
Hold on, while I get a pen.
I havd an urgent message for Annie from a German friend.
Can you tell her to call me on my cell phone as soon as possible?
I'll be in New York for the rest of this week.

Is central heating still not working?
You mean, haven't I repaired it yet?
I just can't figure out what's wrong?
You know what New York plumbers are like.
你知道纽约的水暖工是什么样子的。
We're supposed to be autonomous and self-sufficient.
我们理应做到自主独立且自给自足。
We'll have to get someone in to fix it.
We should be able to deal with this small mechanical problems.

Becuase I'm the only one here with any mechanical skills, and, as I already said, I can't deal with this problem.
I hope the fridge's working at least.
And I mended the freezer too. 

It might have been something to do with the demonstration against that pharmaceutical company.
这可能与那场反对那家制药公司的示威活动有关。

That's all very well in theory
理论上这一切都很好（但实际未必可行）。
But it doesn't working in practice, does it?

We freeze to death, unitl we can find someone who'll fix it for free?

If I known how ro repair it, I would have repaired it.
Is she been__ a cop, she just__ rung off when I answered.
She wouldn't have left her phone number, she'd have called back later.
If it had been anything really serious, the Germans would have contacted me directly.

Meanwhile, the New York Police Department is looking into the theory that a local organization may have helped to carry out the kidnapping.
与此同时，纽约警察局正在调查一种说法 —— 某个当地组织可能协助实施了这起绑架案。
Mr. Lembach was kidnapped two days ago, apparently, by a group of evironmentalist terrorists.
显然，这是一群极端环保主义者所为。

and the apartment only cost four hundrerd eighty thousand__, it's such a lovely neighborhood too; 
Parks are so bording, all those trees and flowers.
公园里到处都是树和花，真是无聊至极。
You see that armchair you're sitting on, it's made from the skins of buffaloes.
buffalo: 水牛
It's a bit enormous, it must be two meters wide.
Now, do you see the curtains and the wallpaper?
curtain: 窗帘
You're right, he's terribly good looking!
Hands off, he's all mine.
Who__ would you dream of it.
I've heard such a lot about you and your family!
I'm just dying to meet her, of course.
我当然非常渴望见到她。

I'd have gone to visit her if I'd known she was in the hospital.
If it had been serious, my mother would have called me on my cell phone.
If John hadn't goine through the red light, the police wouldn't have stopped him.
If we'd had time, we'd have cooked dinner.
What would Mary have said if she'd known I was in love with her boyfriend?

There was a large demonstration against the goverment outside the President's palace.
The President's daughter has been kidnapped; it is not yet known who is responsible.
No one has been in touch with the President's office about it yet, apparently.
Most medicines are produced by Western pharmaceutical companies.
An autonomous, language user is someone who doesn't depend on dictionaries or translations.
一个独立的语言使用者是指不依赖词典或翻译的人。
If we grew out own fruit and vegetables we could be more or less self-sufficient.
如果我们自己种植水果和蔬菜，我们就能或多或少实现自给自足。
That's a very interesting theory, but how can you prove that it's true?

If you don't fix the heating, we are going to freeze to death.
I can't afford this; It's terribly expensive!
When I tell you hands off, I mean it, it's all mine.
I cannot wait to meet your mother; in fact, I am dying to meet her.
That book is so interesting that I can't stop reading it.


We sleep on a double bed.
Jamie has an electric cooker.
Her aparment is just a short walk away from the supermarket.
My new apartment is 100 square meters.
Her furniture is all leather.
I especially love her sofa because it is very soft.
We park our car in the garage.
It is so cold in here! Isn't the central heating working?
Help yourself to a drink. There's ice in the freezer.

If I'd have enough money, I might have rented that apartment.
The toilet works again; the plumber may already have fixed it.
Martin's very smart; he should be able to fix the problem.
The char is made of leather.
While we're on the subject of cops, didn't you get a speeding ticket yesterday?
既然我们谈到了警察，你昨天不是收到了一张超速罚单吗？
No one is believed to know the whereabouts of the missing industralist.
人们认为，无人知晓那位失踪实业家的下落。
Would you be so kind as to give her a message?
能否劳烦你给她捎个口信？
be so kind as to：固定表达，相当于 “劳烦、恳请”，是礼貌程度升级的核心。
I don't really know what Mongolian music sounds like.
