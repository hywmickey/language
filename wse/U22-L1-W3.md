New Tony Moroni Album

Why does Biedermaier think that the people in the seminar are loser? They don't try as hard as other people.
Why didn't Martin pay to get get into the seminar? He works for Biedermaier's company.
While John is listening to the CD, what does he have a dream about? being Tony Moroni's manager.
Why do the two musicians think John might not be a good manager? They think he's too old.
What does Nervous Equipment want John to do? get work for them.
Why can't John listen to the CD? He dosn't have a CD player anymore.

Shall I tell you what you are?
You're losers
While you're just thinking big, the guy next to you is thinking bigger.
While you're just walk tall, the guy over the road is walking taller.
You've got to think bigest!
You've got to walk tallest!
You choose, my friends, you choose.
Well, I've chosen, I'm going to the top.

What an incredible man!
The most incredible thing about him is the money he makes.
Did you pay to get in?
I paid $1500, but it's worth it.
You eat like a loser, you think like a loser.
Of course you're always going to be a loser.
That's not the way(方式) to think.
I'm a winner now, aren't I?

We sell dreams to losers, it's a great business!
It's true, I could be someone.
I could be Tony Moroni's manager!
And now I'd like to say a big, big thank you to my friend and manager John Berry, who has made this all possible.

I've sold my CD player.
I've got nothing to play this on!
Great young duo needs manager to take them to the top.
Must be dynamic(充满活力的) and interested in modern music.
I think he's come about the ad in the music store.
We're Nervous Equipment.
Look, I've just bought the latest Tony Moroni CD!
Aren't you a bit old for this team?
Well, when do I start managing you, and all that kind of stuff?
Why don't we give him a CD?
Is it worth it?
What have we got to lose?
Take it to a record company and get us a contract.
Or find us a place to play live.
I'll be in touch when I have some news.


Don't just think bigger, you've got to think biggest!
You've got to walk tallest of anybody!
Look, I've just bought the latest Tony Moroni CD!
She loves him, he's the cutest body she's ever seen!
Susan is older than Kristi.
The basketball palyer is taller than John.
Italy is the wamest region in Europe today.
He used a map to find the shortest way to Chicago.

He saw an ad for a manager in the music store.
John has a dream about being Tony Moroni's manager.
Joh sold his CD player.
Dudu and Sasa are a duo(二人组).

Dudu and Sasa want John to get them a contract with a record company.
Dudu and Sasa also want John to find them a place to play live.
Dudu and Sasa give John their CD to listen to.
Martin and Biedermaier sell dreams to losers.

If you eat and think like a loser, you'll always be a loser.
That's not the way to think. You have to think you are a winner.

She's just arrived at the airport?
He's already left the office.
I've tried to telephone you for the past three hours, but your number is always busy!
He's driven 300 miles since this morning.

I'd like to finish with an Italian song made famous by(因…… 而知名) Tony Moroni.
我想以一首由托尼・莫罗尼唱红的意大利歌曲来收尾
I'd like to thank my friend and manager who has made all this possible.
Tony Moroni's fantastic! We love him.
I'd like to introduce a dynamic singer from Canada, Miss Celeste Diane!
Thank you, thank you, you wonderful, wonderful people! You've been really amazing.
Well, I've chosen, I'm going to the top.

Mr.Anthony Moroni
Dear Tony,
May I call you Tony? I've been a fan yours ever since I was only 15. I've bought all your CDs, and I think you're absolutely fantastic.
I thought "A Man Alone" was amazing, and "You're Gonna Be Someone" is ever better. What a pity I haven't got a CD play anymore!
This is the reason I'm writing to you, I've just found this amazing new group. I can't quite remember their name, but I know they really like your records.
I wonder if you could help me, I'm their manager, by the way by getting us a recording contract with your company.
Please let me know as soon as possible the contract is ready. You can't call me, I'm afraid, because I haven't got a phone anymore, but you can always write to me. I can't wait to hear from you.
Yours sincerely(真诚地), John Berry.

Please let me know as soon as the contract is ready.
You can't call me, but you can always write to me.
Call me when you decide.
He'll see her when he gets out of prison.
He'll look for a new apartment when he returns from Europe.
He can drink beer when he is 21 years old.
I'll see Heidi when I go to Swizerland.
Say hello to Pat when you see him.
Can you give Sally the package when she comes?

I've been a fan of Tony Moroni's ever since I was only 15.
I've bought all your CDs, and I think you're absolutely fantastic.
Can you get us a record contract with your company?
Well, I've chosen, I'm going to the top.
I paid $1500, but it was worth it.
We sell dreams to losers, it's a great business.
If you want to sing with a rock bank, put an ad in the music store.
They're a good band, but they can't get a contract with a record company.
I'd love to hear that band paly live!
Since he started managing our band, we've had the chance to play live in a lot of places.
