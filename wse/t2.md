现在我们这边本身也缺司机。
You'll get 20 dollars commission.

I don't believe it; I've run out of gas!
Your car's broken down, has it?
I haven't broken down; I'm just out of gas, that's all.
I'll have ten dollars' worth of regular.
我要 10 美元的普通油。
We don't have any attendants here. It's selfservice.

You mean the rusty one with the broken window?
It's not that rusty! It's in quite good condition, considering that it's done over 200,000 miles.

You go straight till you get to the first intersection.
你一直走到第一个十字路口。

确保你是南行的。


You mean you have on idea?
You got to have patience or you make others angry.
You got to = You have got to（口语化缩写），必须、得（相当于 must 或 have to，语气比 have to 更口语化、稍强，强调 “当下的必要性”）
have got to: 必须（美国英语的非正式语体中have有时可省略）；不得不；必定（强调某事的真实性，在美国英语的非正式语体中have有时可省略）

本句结构：加主语 “You” + be 动词原形 “be”，属于 强调式祈使句，用法特点：
强调动作的执行者是 “你”（而非他人），避免歧义；
语气比普通祈使句更温和、委婉，带 “商量 / 提醒” 意味（而非强硬命令）；
否定式：You don’t be late!（你别迟到！）/ You not be absent!（你别缺席！）
Not many opportunities to see him, are there?
没多少机会见他，对吧？

Hello, Can I have $20 of regular?
I'm sorry, but I don't work here. You'll have to ask the cashier.
cashier: 收银员
Hi there, can you fill me up, please?
This is self-service station, fill it yourself. Which is your car?
The one over there with the broken window.
It's still in good condition, even though it's done over a hundred thousand miles.
And in all that time it's never broken down.
