My motorcycle is out of gas again.
I need to get my car to that gas station, so can you help me push my car there?
I've run out of energy because I was swimming all day, so I really need to rest now.

Considering that I have more money than you do, why don't you let me pay?
代动词 do 的作用：此处 do 是代动词，代替前面的实义动词 have，避免重复（完整形式是 than you have），符合英语 “简洁表达” 原则；
How dare you say such a thing to your mother! You should apologize!
My car window is broken, so do you know where I can have it repaired?
Why don't you have Silvia do something with your hair; she really knows how to cut hair nicely.

什么是代动词
代动词是英语中**用来替代前文已经出现过的实义动词（或动词短语）的词**，核心作用是**避免重复**，让句子更简洁流畅。英语中最常用的代动词是 **do/does/did**，此外 **be动词（am/is/are/was/were）**、**have/has/had** 等也可根据前文动词的类型充当代动词，且时态、人称需与前文动词保持一致。

一、核心代动词分类及用法（附例句）
1. 最常用代动词：do/does/did（替代**实义动词原形/过去式/现在分词**，适用于除be动词、完成时have外的多数动词）
这是日常交流中最频繁的代动词用法，尤其在比较句、省略句、回应句中常见。
- **肯定句中**：替代前文的实义动词，保持时态一致
  例1：He works harder than you **do**.（他比你工作努力。→ do替代works）
  例2：I ate an apple, and she **did** too.（我吃了个苹果，她也吃了。→ did替代ate）
  例3：你之前纠错句中的用法：I have more money than you **do**.（我比你有钱。→ do替代have，避免重复说“than you have”）
- **否定句中**：用 don’t/doesn’t/didn’t 替代“实义动词+not”
  例：She doesn’t like coffee, but I **do**.（她不喜欢咖啡，但我喜欢。→ do替代like coffee）

2. be动词作代动词（替代前文的**be动词短语**，适用于主系表结构）
前文出现am/is/are/was/were时，用对应的be动词形式替代，避免重复系表结构。
- 例1：Tom is a student, and his sister **is** too.（汤姆是学生，他妹妹也是。→ is替代is a student）
- 例2：They were late yesterday, and we **were** too.（他们昨天迟到了，我们也迟到了。→ were替代were late）
- 例3：A: Are you tired? B: Yes, I **am**.（A：你累吗？B：是的，我累。→ am替代am tired）

3. have/has/had作代动词（替代前文的**完成时结构**或**实义动词have**）
分两种情况，一是替代“have/has/had+过去分词”的完成时，二是替代“拥有”含义的实义动词have。
- 替代完成时：
  例：She has finished her homework, and I **have** too.（她做完作业了，我也做完了。→ have替代have finished her homework）
- 替代实义动词have（表“拥有”，多用于英式英语）：
  例：A: Do you have a pen? B: Yes, I **do**.（美式常用，do替代have a pen）/ Yes, I **have**.（英式常用，have替代have a pen）

二、代动词的高频使用场景
1. **比较状语从句**（than/as引导的句子）：这是你之前句子中用到的场景，核心是简化比较对象后的动词重复。
   例：She runs faster than he **does**.（她比他跑得快。→ does替代runs）
2.  **简短回应/附和句**（表示“也/不”）：日常对话中快速回应，避免啰嗦。
    例：A: I love music. B: Me **too**.（A：我喜欢音乐。B：我也是。→ 口语中省略do，完整是I do too）
3.  **反义疑问句**：结尾的附加疑问用代动词替代主句的实义动词。
    例：You went to the park yesterday, **didn’t you**?（你昨天去公园了，对吧？→ didn’t you替代didn’t go to the park）
4.  **避免动词重复的并列句**：前后分句动词一致时，后句用代动词。
    例：He will call you, and I **will** too.（他会给你打电话，我也会。→ will替代will call you）

三、使用注意事项（避免踩坑）
1.  **时态/人称必须一致**：代动词的形式要和前文被替代的动词保持时态、单复数一致。
    ✅ 正确：She sings well, and her brother **does** too.（does对应sings的第三人称单数）
    ❌ 错误：She sings well, and her brother do too.
2.  **不能替代非谓语动词**：代动词只能替代句子中的谓语动词，不能替代不定式、动名词等非谓语形式。
    例：I want to go shopping, and she wants to **too**.（此处不能用does替代to go shopping，需保留to）
3.  **实义动词have的特殊处理**：美式英语中常用do/does/did替代表“拥有”的have，英式英语可直接用have/has/had替代。

This is a self-service station, so you have to get the gas yourself. 为什么不用 by yourself?

这句话中用 **yourself** 和 **by yourself** 语法上都正确，但核心差异在于 **语义侧重不同**，原句用 **yourself** 更贴合自助加油站的场景需求，精准强调“动作需亲自执行”，而 **by yourself** 会偏离场景核心语义。下面结合用法本质、场景适配和对比示例，详细拆解：
一、核心差异：反身代词 vs 介词短语的功能不同
1. 原句用 **yourself**：强调“动作亲自做，而非他人代劳”
- **词性与作用**：**反身代词**（作宾语补足语），紧贴动词 `get`，用于强调 **动作的执行者是主语本人**，排除“别人帮忙加油”的可能性，核心语义是“亲手完成动作”。
- **场景适配**：自助加油站的核心规则是“自己动手加油，没有工作人员代劳”，这里的 `yourself` 正是突出这一核心要求——加油这个动作必须你自己做，不是别人帮你做。
- **例句拓展**：
  - You have to sign the document **yourself**.（你必须亲自签这份文件。→ 强调亲手签，不能代签）
  - She made the cake **herself**.（这蛋糕是她亲手做的。→ 突出亲手制作）

2. 若用 **by yourself**：强调“独自一人做，无他人陪伴/协助”
- **词性与作用**：**介词短语**（作方式状语），核心语义是 **“独自、单独”**，侧重描述“做某事时的状态是孤身一人”，而非强调“动作是否亲自执行”。
- **场景偏离**：自助加油站不限制“是否独自加油”——你完全可以和朋友一起去，朋友在旁边等，你自己动手加油（符合自助规则）。但如果用 `by yourself`，句子含义会变成“你得独自一人去加油”，这和加油站“自助”的核心提示无关，属于语义跑偏。
- **例句拓展**：
  - I finished the project **by myself**.（我独自一人完成了这个项目。→ 强调没人帮忙、孤身完成）
  - Don’t go out **by yourself** at night.（晚上别独自出门。→ 强调孤身一人的状态）

二、关键用法对比表（一目了然）
| 用法                | 核心语义                | 侧重点                  | 适配场景                  | 原句替换后的效果                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **get the gas yourself** | 自己动手加油            | 动作亲自执行，排除代劳  | 自助服务提示（核心需求）  | 符合场景，精准传达“自助”规则              |
| **get the gas by yourself** | 独自一人加油            | 做动作时孤身一人，无陪伴 | 强调“独处状态”的场景      | 语义偏离，暗示“不能和他人同行”，不符合实际 |

三、特殊情况：何时可用 by yourself？
只有当你想强调“加油时没有其他人协助/陪伴”时，才适合用 `by yourself`，但这和“自助加油站”的常规提示无关。  
例：If your friend is busy, you’ll have to get the gas **by yourself**.（如果你的朋友没空，你就得自己一个人去加油了。→ 此处强调“没人陪伴帮忙”，符合 `by yourself` 的语义）

四、补充：反身代词（oneself）与 by oneself 的通用区别
1. **反身代词（myself/yourself/herself）**：常与动词搭配，强调 **“亲自、亲手”**，是动作的核心补充，突出“谁来做”；
2.  **by oneself**：表 **“独自、独立”**，是对动作状态的描述，突出“做的时候有没有别人”。

简单记：**“亲自做”用 oneself，“独自做”用 by oneself**。原句自助加油站的核心是“亲自动手”，所以用 `yourself` 是最地道的选择。

All passengers must go through Immigration Control.
Please have your passports ready as you approach Immigration Control.
当你靠近入境边防检查处时，请准备好你的护照。
Please have your passports ready: have + 宾语（your passports）+ 形容词（ready） 使役结构，表 “让某物处于某种状态”，译为 “准备好某物”，是官方指引的高频句式，比 “Please prepare your passports” 更简洁直接。
 as you approach: 当你靠近 / 抵达…… 时，as 此处引导时间状语从句，表 “动作发生的时机”；approach 为动词，意为 “靠近、临近”，比 when you get close to 更正式，适配官方场景。

Dear Annie,
It was very nice to see you the other day, even though we hardly had a chance to talk to each other properly.
I'm very sorry to have wasted your time trying to sell you a washine machine, I should have realized that fanatical Greens don't like their clothes clean(my little joke). Of course, if you've changed your mind about the machine, you know where to get hold of me.
Anyway, that isn't the reason why I'm writing - although, if you were interested in a machine, I'd be happy to demostrate one to you - is to apologize for upsetting you by talking about your late father Hugo.
I really shouldn't have mentioned him after all, he was your only father, if you see what I mean.
The other reason why I'm writing to you, as well of course as offering you another chance to buy a Laundroperk machine, is to tell you about a rather interesting customer I picked up at JFK airport the other day.
(I drive a cab now, you see, which is why I collect this person at the airport, as I said)
The point is, this guy I collected looked exactly like Hugo, except for the beard and mustache, he didn't have them, that is, but Hugo did, as I'm sure you remember.
I asked him if he'd ever heard of Hugo, but he said he hadn't, in fact, he seemed to be quite offended, and he got out of my cab without paying! Just think, there's someone else around who looks just like your poor dead father!
The other reason I'm writing to you is to suggest that we get together for a chat about old times, your Dad, maybe washing machines, and stuff like that. Perhaps we could go to a club one evening?
Looking forward to hearing from you.
P. S. If you don't need a washing machine, perhaps a friend of yours does?
Sorry to go on about it, but if you are interested in the Laundroperk machine, could you let me know soon, so that I can get in touch with the company that sells them?
fanatical Greens: 狂热的绿党

The car park, where all the other cars are, is right outside the hotel.
These cigars, which I bought at the duty-free shop, are from Cuba.
Do you have any insurance for your car which is illegally parked?
You look like someone whom I used to know.
The car, when you accelerate, has a top speed of over 90.
I've stopped a guy who claims to be a cab-driver.
He picked up a man called Theo Gusper, who looked exactly like Hugo Peters.
John, whose car is very old, didn't see the red light.
I know a garage where you can have your car repaired.
Do you remember the day when John arrived late for work?
The customer, whom John recognized, said his name was Gusper.
There's the man whose car was towed away!

If we are going to buy a lot of things, let's at least get a shopping cart.
If I ask you about a demostic product, I am asking you about something which is made in your country.
He offended her by guessing that her age was older than it is really is.
How can I remove these spots from the windows?
Henry is really starting to be a nuisance: he is always knocking on my door to ask a stupid question.
Let's buy something at the duty-free shop before getting on the plane.
This problem is due to your lack of effort.
Please make the check payable to me.
请把支票抬头写我。
请把支票开具为可支付给我的形式。
请将支票收款人填写为本人。
这张支票请抬头写我。
payable to ： 应付给；收款人；支票抬头；支票抬头请写
You can really feel the acceleration of this car when it goes fast.
If you want to stop, just put your foot down on the brakes.
如果你想停车，只需踩下刹车。

翻译：Passengers with connecting flights to destinations within the United States need not go through Immigration Control, but should go straight to the Domestic Departures lounge.

一、核心翻译（直译+场景化正式表达）
- **直译**：前往美国境内目的地、搭乘联程航班的乘客无需经过入境边防检查，但需直接前往国内出发候机厅。
- **机场官方标准翻译**：**搭乘美国境内联程航班的旅客，无需办理入境边检手续，可直接前往国内出发候机厅。**
- **口语简化版（广播/指引）**：美国国内联程旅客不用过边检，直接去国内出发候机厅即可。

（注：原句为**机场转机官方指引**，翻译需兼顾专业性和实用性——术语精准、语句简洁，符合旅客快速获取信息的需求，同时避免口语化表达导致歧义。）

二、关键术语/短语深度解析（贴合航空场景）
1. Passengers with connecting flights
- **译法**：搭乘联程航班的乘客/联程旅客  
- **术语说明**：`connecting flights` 指**联程航班**（同一张机票、需转机但无需重新托运行李的航班），区别于 `transfer flights`（泛指转机航班，可含不同航空公司）；`with` 译为“搭乘”而非“拥有”，贴合航空场景语义。
- **搭配例句**：Passengers with connecting flights please wait at Gate 5.（搭乘联程航班的旅客请在5号登机口等候。）

2. destinations within the United States
- **译法**：美国境内目的地  
- **语境强调**：`within` 明确“境内”，是翻译核心——正因为是**美国国内转机**，才无需过入境边检（若为国际转机则需办理），语义逻辑不可省略。
- **同义替换**：U.S. domestic destinations（更简洁，机场标识常用）

3. need not go through
- **译法**：无需经过/无需办理  
- **语法解析**：`need not` 是**情态动词用法**，表“不必”，比 `do not need to` 更正式，适配官方通知场景；`go through` 此处意为“通过（官方手续/检查）”，而非“穿过（空间）”。
- **场景例句**：You need not go through security again for domestic transfers.（国内转机无需再次过安检。）

4. Immigration Control
- **译法**：入境边防检查（简称“边检”）  
- **专业说明**：航空场景核心术语，指跨国出行时的**入境身份核查**（检查护照、签证等），不可译为“移民控制”（字面义，不符合中文机场表述）；国内转机无需此环节，国际转机必须办理。
- **对应场景**：机场标识常缩写为 **Immigration** 或 **边检**。

5. Domestic Departures lounge
- **译法**：国内出发候机厅  
- **术语拆解**：`Domestic Departures`（国内出发，机场固定标识），`lounge` 此处特指“旅客候机的专用区域”，译为“候机厅”而非“休息室”（避免与机场VIP休息室混淆）。
- **简化标识**：机场常见缩写为 **Domestic Departures**（无需译出lounge，标识牌已明确功能）。

三、句子结构与翻译逻辑（贴合中文表达习惯）
原句是 **转折关系并列句**（but连接），英文重心在前，中文翻译时调整为**重心在后**，更符合中文“先前提条件，后核心指引”的逻辑：
1. 英文原序：乘客（条件：联程+美国境内）→ 无需过边检 → 但需去国内出发厅  
2. 中文调整：（条件前置）搭乘美国境内联程航班的旅客 → （核心动作1）无需办理边检 → （核心动作2）直接前往国内出发厅  
→ 调整原因：中文通知类文本习惯“条件先行”，让旅客快速定位自身是否适用该指引。

四、同义句替换（适配不同场景）
1.  **机场广播版（更简洁）**：Passengers connecting to U.S. domestic flights are exempt from Immigration Control and should proceed directly to the Domestic Departures lounge.  
    （对应中文：美国国内联程旅客免办入境边检，直接前往国内出发候机厅。）
2.  **书面通知版（更正式）**：Travelers with onward domestic flights within the United States do not need to complete Immigration formalities; instead, they shall proceed straight to the Domestic Departures area.  
    （对应中文：搭乘美国境内后续国内航班的旅客无需办理入境手续，需直接前往国内出发区域。）
3.  **标识牌极简版**：Domestic Connecting Flights: No Immigration → Direct to Domestic Departures  
    （对应中文：国内联程：无需边检 → 直达国内出发）



我可以帮你将这句翻译适配成机场广播稿（中英文对照）、登机口指引牌文字等具体形式，需要吗？

only 表 “只是、只不过” 的高频例句

这种用法在日常口语中极为常见，尤其适合描述 “整体符合、仅一处例外” 的场景：

1. The movie is great, only it’s a bit too long.（这部电影很棒，只是有点太长了。）
2. This dress fits perfectly, only the color is not my favorite.（这条裙子版型超合适，只不过颜色不是我喜欢的。）
3. He plays the guitar exactly like a professional, only he has never taken any lessons.（他弹吉他简直像专业选手，只是从没上过任何课程。）

举一些例子,  be of + 抽象名词 结构 ，等价于 be + 对应形容词
“be of + 抽象名词”是英语中**正式且地道的表达结构**，核心作用是替代“be + 对应形容词”，让语言更简洁、书面化，广泛用于商务、学术、职场等正式场景。以下按**高频程度+场景分类**整理典型例子，每例均包含“原结构+等价形容词结构+中英双语例句”，方便直接套用：
一、通用高频基础款（日常/正式场景都适用）

| be of + 抽象名词 | 等价 be + 形容词 | 英文例句 | 中文翻译 |
|------------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| be of assistance | be helpful（有帮助的） | We are always of assistance to new employees. | 我们始终愿意为新员工提供帮助。 |
| be of importance | be important（重要的） | This meeting is of great importance. | 这次会议至关重要。 |
| be of value | be valuable（有价值的） | Your feedback is of great value to us. | 你的反馈对我们极具价值。 |
| be of use | be useful（有用的） | This tool is of little use in daily work. | 这个工具在日常工作中没什么用处。 |
| be of interest | be interesting（有趣的） | The report is of particular interest to the team. | 这份报告让团队特别感兴趣。 |

二、职场/商务进阶款（正式沟通、邮件、报告常用）
| be of + 抽象名词 | 等价 be + 形容词 | 英文例句 | 中文翻译 |
|------------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| be of benefit | be beneficial（有益的） | This policy is of benefit to all employees. | 这项政策对所有员工都有益。 |
| be of significance | be significant（有重大意义的） | The cooperation is of great significance for both companies. | 此次合作对双方公司都意义重大。 |
| be of relevance | be relevant（相关的） | This data is of no relevance to the project. | 这些数据与该项目无关。 |
| be of urgency | be urgent（紧急的） | The matter is of extreme urgency. | 这件事极其紧急。 |
| be of reliability | be reliable（可靠的） | This supplier is of high reliability. | 这家供应商的可靠性很高。 |

三、学术/专业场景款（论文、技术文档常用）
| be of + 抽象名词 | 等价 be + 形容词 | 英文例句 | 中文翻译 |
|------------------|------------------|----------|----------|
| be of validity | be valid（有效的） | The research method is of strong validity. | 该研究方法具有很强的有效性。 |
| be of accuracy | be accurate（准确的） | The test result is of high accuracy. | 测试结果的准确度很高。 |
| be of consistency | be consistent（一致的） | The experimental data is of good consistency. | 实验数据具有良好的一致性。 |
| be of complexity | be complex（复杂的） | This system is of considerable complexity. | 这个系统具有相当高的复杂性。 |

四、结构使用关键注意事项
1.  **修饰程度**：常搭配 `great/ little/ much/ particular/ extreme` 等词，强化语气，如“of great importance”（至关重要）、“of little use”（用处不大），比直接用“very important”“not very useful”更正式；
2.  **抽象名词属性**：此处的抽象名词多为**不可数名词**，无复数形式，如 assistance/ importance/ value，不能写成“be of assistances”；
3.  **场景适配**：日常口语中可优先用形容词（如“Your advice is helpful”），而正式书面语中用“be of + 抽象名词”（如“Your advice is of great help”）更显专业。
