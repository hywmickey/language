Dear Bo-Bae,
I'm writing to you from Riverbank Park, by the side of the Hudson River. I've come here with the other students from the English class for a picnic, it's a beautiful day, and the sun is shining!
We have just had lunch, I wanted sandwiches made with white bread, but the other students ate them all, so I had to ate brown bread. I complained to the teacher, but he just laughed.
Perhaps he was thinking about love. He's just got engaged to one of the students, a Mexician girl. She's a very pleasent and resonable girl, and I'm sure they'll be happy together.
I spoke to the director of the school yesterday, by the way, to ask him how much longer I needed to stay there.
He told me that I needed to stay another couple of years if I wanted to speak English really well. He also said that I could take extra private lessons if I wanted to for $150 an hour. It's a bit expensive really, I'm not sure what to do.
Anyway, I'll be home at the end of next month for the summer vacation. I'll see you then.
Your loving husband, Kim

You make very few mistakes in grammar when you speak.

I am not hungry, I have just had lunch.
My boss told me that I needed to imporve my English if I wanted to make more money.
He drove her to work when her car was broken.
I don't think my teacher is very nice. Yesterday, he laughed at a student's pronunciation.

They took a boat to the island.
Meet me at the entrance to the park in two hours.
There's a nice place to see the whole city on the top of hill.
It's too cold to swim in that lake!
Take off your shoes and walk on the gress, It feels great!
England is nice, but it rains too much.
It's such a nice day. We should have a picnic at the park.
