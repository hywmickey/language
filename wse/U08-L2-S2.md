This is Burgertron. Let's go in!
John asks for one megaburger, one fries and two beers. Anything else, sir?
What can I do? It doesn't matter.
So can we go now, Kristi?
Where do you want to work? Let's go out!

Would you like anything to eat?
No thanks. I don't want anything to eat.

John doesn't want anything else.
He doesn't want anything to drink.

Renzo: Here is your table, Mr. Petri. And here's the menu, madam.
Kristi: You don't like independent women, do you Roger?
Roger asks for the check so he can pay.
Kristi has a gin and tonic at Roger's apartment.
Would you like a drink first, or do you want to eat now? I want to eat now. I'm hungry. Ok Let's eat now.
A bottle of white wine, please, Renzo.
It's OK, I can pay. No Kristi, please, I want to pay.
I don't like the soup. I prefer vegetable soup.
Would you like a German beer or a Japanese beer? German, please.
Would you like coffee or tea? I perfer coffee.
Wow, this place is really expensive? Oh, that doesn't matter.
You're just an airline pilot, aren't you, Roger? Oh, I do all right. Money's no problem.
Da Renzo is an expensive restaurant, but Burgertron is very cheap.
What would you like? Something really good, Renzo.
Would you like something to eat, Madam?
There is something Jorn doesn't like.
