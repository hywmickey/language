My best suit was stolen.
And the first time we were interrupted by those crasy Russians.
It was repaired last week, Obviously it wasn't made in Germany.

What do you mean: is that a good idea?
Can't you just let yourself go and have fun?
你就不能放开点，好好玩一场吗？
It's just that I've got this feeling.
我就是有这种感觉而已。
I'm just certain that something terrible is goig to happen.
I always know when it's going to rain or snow.
I'll try to be more positive.

I was just passing, so I thought I'd say "Hi" and introduce you to my new boyfriend, Bashir.
Hi, Marco, Great to see you!

I'll tell you how get there.
get the M11 bus.
and as you go out of the station, there's a bus stop on you left.

Go up to the lights, make a right, and then take the first left.

Have you two been going out together for long?
I've been expecting a call.
I've got some great news. I've found an apartment at last!
I've moved out of that awful hotel.
I've only been living in this apartment for a few days.
I've really been looking forward to a nice evening together.
我一直特别期待能和你一起度过一个愉快的夜晚。
I've even cooked a meal, which is something I don't often do.

You know the English saying: "Third time lucky".
Well, never mind, that's life.

So, did you have to walk up the stairs?
Yes, the elevator was out of order.
It was repaired last week, and then it broke down again the following day.
There isn't much furniture yet, as you can see.
I took the place unfurnished.
