THE CITY OF LIGHTS

One of the most famous cities in the world is Paris, also known as the city of lights. This name stems from its monuments, of which there are many, that light up each night. Its romantic streets, crowded cafes, and remarkable museums, architecture, and streets attract over 30 million tourists each year. In fact, it is the most popular tourist destination in the world surpassing Rome, Vienna, and London.

Everyone knows about Paris, whether it is because of the famous designers who make it their headquarters, or because of the perception that it is the trendiest, yet most traditionally beautiful place on earth. Regardless, everyone imagines a city full of budding artists, delicious coffee houses, and beautiful women.

The population of Paris is about 2,153,600 in the center, but if one includes it suburbs, which have a population of almost 10 million, then it is one of the most populated areas in Europe.

Paris began as a fishing village called Lutetia Parisiorum, named for the Gaulist tribe of Parisii, in the third century B.C. In 52 B. C. Julius Caesar conquered Lutetia Parisiorum. By the fourth century A.D., its name was changed to Paris, and in 987, Paris' count Hugh Capet became King of France and madeParis its capital.

Now thanks to its rich history, Paris boasts over 100 canals, churches,
monuments, museums, hotels, and fountains. The best way to see the sightsis on food by taxi. In addition to taxis, there are three major ways that a person can ger around Paris. One is the Metro, which is the underground rapid transit system. It has 14 lines and runs from about 5 a.m to about 1 a.m. Then there is the RER, which is an express transit systems and it connects Paris with its suburbs. Finally, there is a bus system.

The climate of Paris is temperate, but can experience sudden showers throughout the year and snow in the winter.

The major sites to see are such landmarks as Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Elysees, the Arc de Triomphe, the Basilica of the Sacre Coeur, the Invalides, the Pantheon, the Grande Arche, and the Opera Garnier. In addition to these landmarks, there are the famous parks like Disneyland Resort Paris and the fantastic museums such as the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay or the Musee National d'Arte Moderne.

Out of all the sites mentioned above, and indeed out of all the sites in Paris, the Eiffel Tower is amone the most interesting and probably the most well-known. It was build as a temporary piece by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 Universal Exposition and later became a symbol of Paris. However, when it was first erected, it horrified those that lived in the city. They thought of it as an eyesore, and could not understand such a terrible monstrosity in their beautiful city. How ironic that such a building would today be the one thing everyone associates with Paris.

Apart from these sites and attractions, perhaps what best exemplifies Paris are its sources for entertainment and everyday life. Paris is rife with opera houses, theaters and concert halls, dance halls and discos, move theaters, and cafes and restaurants. Because of everything that Paris has to offer, it earns much revenue in tourism. It has a gross domestic product responsible for almost one third-of France's economy.

Paris is very multicultural. It has immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Asia and other parts of the world. However, the French are very adamant about being French first and then recognizing whatever other cultural identity they may have. They are people who are very proud of their country even though it is quite normal to see the average French citizen complaining about the government.

All in all, Paris is a diverse and heavily populated metropolis intertwined with ancient treasures. It has entertainment, beauty, and culture. When one comes to Paris, there is no fear of getting bored or not enjoying life. For the 30 million annual visitors it receives, Paris may just have it all.

    主谓宾结构：主语 I + 谓语 can do with + 宾语 a bit more money（a bit more 修饰不可数名词 money）
    核心语法点：固定短语 “can do with + 名词” 的用法（表需求）
    第二句：I really need just a little more to get through the end of the month.
    主谓宾结构：主语 I + 谓语 need + 宾语 just a little more（省略前文的 money，避免重复）
    目的状语：to get through the end of the month（不定式短语作目的状语，说明 “需要钱” 的用途）
    核心语法点：不定式作目的状语；省略句（省略重复宾语 money）；“get through + 时间段” 的搭配
- 同义改写（3 种风格）
    正式版：I require a small additional sum of money. I truly need just a modest amount to sustain myself until the end of the month.（改写思路：用 require 替代 can do with，a small additional sum of money 替代 a bit more money，truly 替代 really，modest amount 替代 a little more，sustain myself 替代 get through，增强正式感；译文：我需要一小笔额外资金。我确实只需要不多的一笔钱，就能支撑到月底。）
    口语版：I could use a little extra cash! I just need a tiny bit more to make it to the end of the month.（改写思路：could use 替代 can do with（口语高频表达），a little extra cash 替代 a bit more money，tiny bit 替代 a little，make it 替代 get through（日常口语 “撑过去”）；译文：我能再要点儿现金不！就差一丁点儿，就能熬到月底了。）
    书面简洁版：I need a bit more money to get through month-end—just a little will suffice.（改写思路：整合两句话逻辑，用破折号衔接补充说明，month-end 替代 the end of the month，will suffice 替代 need，使表达更凝练；译文：我需要再多一点钱撑到月底 —— 一点点就够了。）
- 拓展例句（基于核心结构 “表达资金需求 + 说明用途”）
    She can do with a bit more support to finish the project on time.（她还需要再多一点支持，才能按时完成项目。）
    We really need just a little more funding to launch the new product.（我们真的就差一点点资金，就能推出新产品了。）
    He could use a bit more time to prepare for the interview—just one more day.（他还需要再多一点时间准备面试，就多一天就行。）
