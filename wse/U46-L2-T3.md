我想他对西班牙裔有偏见。
He's prejudiced in favor of that awful Sanchez.
他偏袒那个糟糕的桑切斯。

He is up against a superior player.
他正对阵一位实力更强的选手。
    be up against：此处表示 “面对（强劲对手、困难局面）”，强调对抗性和挑战性，而非简单的 “遇见”。
    例：We’re up against a tight deadline.（我们面临紧迫的截止日期。）
    superior：修饰人时指 “（能力、水平）更优秀的、更强的”，后接介词 to（而非 than），如 “He is superior to most players.”（他比大多数选手都强。）
Sanchez will be this year's champion, there's no doubt about it.
He may have more physical strength than Barrington, but Barrington is a more skillful player.
他可能比巴灵顿更有体力，但巴灵顿是一个更熟练的球员。

That ball looked to me like it was inside the line.
在我看来，那个球好像是压线内的。
It looked as though Sanchez missed the slot deliberately.
从情况来看，桑切斯似乎是故意错过了那个空位。
as though：好像…；仿佛
deliberately：故意地、有意地

That guy is trying to put me off my game.
那家伙正试图干扰我，让我发挥失常。/那家伙想让我放弃比赛。
put sb off one's game: 通过干扰、扰乱节奏等方式，让某人在擅长的事情（如比赛、工作、技能展示等）中无法正常发挥

I didn't realize you were so incredibly sensitive.
我没想到你极其的敏感。
Maybe you preferred it if we played back to back.
preferred it if（“it” 指代后文的 “if 从句”，使句子语法通顺），不可省略 “it”。

别跟我说那种讽刺、轻蔑的废话！
You despise me, don't you, you arrogant son of a bitch?
你鄙视我，不是吗，你这个傲慢的混蛋。

看那人是怎么挤过去的！
Here we are, sir, this is Number One Court.
先生，我们到了，这就是 1 号球场。
Can you see where he's heading for?
你能看到他正朝哪个方向去吗？
heading for: 是核心动作表达，含义为 “朝…… 方向移动、前往……”，强调 “正在朝着某个目标方向行进”，区别于单纯的 “going to”（后者更侧重 “计划去某地”，前者更侧重 “当下的移动方向”）。
    He's heading for the exit.（他正朝出口走去。）—— 强调 “正在朝出口移动” 的动作；
    He's going to the exit.（他要去出口。）—— 更侧重 “计划去出口” 的意图。
I can't quite make it out.
我不太能看清楚 / 辨认出来。
There's a guy in the second row from the front who just got up.
Where's your buddy?
你的朋友呢？

He went towards the exit, that way!
Watch out!

Isn't there another way of saying "I speak English very well"?
Yeah, there are several other ways of saying it.
I speak English perfectly.
Anyone else? The word begins with "f".
Fluently!
I just looked the word up in my dictionary.
It's correct to say "I speak English fluently", and it's also correct to say "I speak fluent English", isn't it?
Then why is it incorrect to say "I speak fluently English"?

I've got a bit of headache; I was planning to go home.
We've never spent time in your apartment; it would make a nice change.
We'll get a Chinese meal to go on the way home.
I adore Chinese food!
This sweet and sour pork is delicious! How's yours, David?
I'll see if there's anything worth watching on television.
OK, I'll put on a CD. Do you feel like classical or rock?
好的，我会放一张CD。你喜欢古典音乐还是摇滚乐？
Why can't we just talk to each other?

What's going to happen when Juanita comes back?
Can't we deal with problems when they arise; do we have to go looking for them beforehand?
难道我们不能等问题出现了再处理吗？非要提前去寻找问题吗？
arise： 是正式用词，表 “（问题、困难等）产生、出现”（区别于 “appear”，“arise” 更侧重 “自然发生”，如 “problems arise”“conflicts arise”）
beforehand：提前、预先
You're such a pessimist sometimes!
你有时候真是悲观！
You see everying as a terribly serious problem.
Personally, I think of it as an opportunity.
An opportunity for Juanita to scream in Spanish, and throw all the pots and pans in the kitchen at me.

丹尼尔真烦人。他一次又一次地打扰我。
I feel that what you said about me is contemptuous.
我觉得你对的关于我的话带有轻蔑/鄙视意味。
Why are you crying? I was just joking. You can't really be that sensitive.
He is so arrogant because he thinks he is better than everyone else.
他太傲慢了，因为他认为自己比其他人都好。
I really adore him so much that I can't think of anyone I would rather have as a champion.
我真的非常崇拜他，以至于想不出还有谁比他更适合当冠军。
would rather have sb as...: 更愿意让某人担任……（表 “主观偏好中的最优选择”）
“would rather”（更愿意）+ “have”（拥有 / 使役）的组合， 
    “have” 隐含 “让、使” 的含义，后接 “人 + 名词（角色）” 或 “人 + 动词原形”，表示更希望某人处于某状态或做某事。
    （接 “人 + 角色”）I can’t think of anyone I would rather have as a champion.
    （我想不出还有谁比他更适合当冠军。——“have sb as + 角色” 表示 “让某人担任某角色”）
    （接 “人 + 动词原形”）：I would rather have you help me with this task than do it alone.
    （我更希望你帮我做这个任务，而不是我自己做。——“have sb do sth” 表示 “让某人做某事”）
     
He talks to me as though I were a child.
It doesn't taste good. It tastes like it's burned.
It doesn't smell good at all. It smells like garbage.
He just went right on playing. He didn't stop when I asked him something. He just acted as though he hadn't heard me.
He did't wave at me or say hello. He kept right on walking as though he hadn't seen me.
You are so sweet. You are just like sugar.

You always think someting bad is going to happen. You are such a pessimist.
I think if you give him time, he can change. People just need time to become a different person.
This is not a terribly serious problem. It is one that can be fixed in a minute.
You should think beforehand. Don't just act without thinking first.
She has a very violent way of dealing with problems. She screams and throws things.
Don't look at getting fired as a terrible thing. Think of it as an opportunity to find a job you love.
When problems arise, I tackle them straight on. I don't think it's a good idea to sit around.
当问题出现时，我会直接着手处理。我觉得闲坐着（不行动）不是个好办法。
- “tackle”：核心动词，表 “主动应对、着手处理（难题）”，比 “deal with” 更强调 “积极解决的态度”；
- “them”：指代前文 “problems”；
- “straight on”：副词短语作状语，表 “直接地、不绕弯地”，强化 “不拖延、直面问题” 的动作
- “sit around”：核心短语，表 “无所事事地闲坐、消极等待”，隐含 “不采取行动” 的负面含义

MEN'S FINAL SENSATION - BARRINGTON BREAKS THROUGH!
Barrington Smashes Sanchez
This year's open certainly hasn't been short of excitement, and the most breathtaking match in the whole series was, appropriately enough, the men's finals.

The lowest score in tennis is love.
网球比赛中的最低分是零分（love）。
If she wins this set, she'll be the champion.
如果她赢下这一盘，她就会成为冠军。
    句中 set 是体育赛事的专属术语，含义需结合具体运动场景：
    在网球、羽毛球等项目中，指 “盘”（比赛的大单元，通常需赢 2-3 盘才能获胜），如网球的 “三盘两胜制”（best of three sets）；
    在排球、乒乓球等项目中，可译为 “局”（比赛的小单元，如排球通常赢 5 局得 3 局者胜）。
Tennis is a great spectator sport because there's a lot of action.
网球是一项观赏性很强的运动，因为有很多动作。
If we want to play tennis this afternoon, we'll have to reserve a court.
如果我们今天下午想打网球，我们就得预订一个球场。
I don't know why he got that point. The ball was clearly out.
我不明白他为什么能拿到那一分 —— 那球明明出界了。
He's a really good umpire. Apart from having a good eye, he is really fair.
他是一位非常出色的裁判。除了观察力敏锐之外，他还相当公正。
Whose turn is it to serve the ball? It's Barrington's service.
该谁发球了？该巴林顿发球了。
    serve：动词，指 “（球员）发球” 的动作，常见搭配为 “serve the ball”（发球）、“serve well”（发球质量高）。
    例：He serves with a lot of spin.（他发球时旋转很强。）
    service：名词，此处特指 “发球权 / 发球轮次”（网球中每局由一方固定发球，即 “发球局”，该方拥有 “service”），也可泛指 “发球动作或发球质量”。
    例：This is her service game.（这是她的发球局。） / His service is hard to return.（他的发球很难接。
Barrington may be really famous, but Sanchez is a superior player.
巴林顿或许名气很大，但桑切斯才是实力更强的选手。
Being a good sports player is not just about physical strengh.
成为一名优秀的运动员，不仅仅在于身体素质。
physical strength：此处并非仅指 “体力”，而是涵盖运动员的综合身体条件（如力量、耐力、爆发力、柔韧性、反应速度等），是运动表现的基础。
We have great seats for the match. We're on the third row up from the court.
我们看这场比赛的座位绝佳 —— 就在离球场往上数第三排。

---

翻译：I can't quite make it out.

核心翻译
我不太能看清楚/辨认出来。（“it”指代前文提到的事物，如“那个东西”“那个声音”“那段文字”等）


补充解析
1. 场景定位与核心短语“make out”的含义
“make out”是本句的关键短语，含义需结合**上下文场景**判断，核心是“通过感官（视觉、听觉）或思维努力后，仍无法清晰识别/理解”，常见场景分为3类：
- **视觉场景（最常用）**：指“看不清、辨不出具体事物”，比如远处的物体、模糊的人影、细小的文字等。  
  例：对方指着远处模糊的影子问“那是什么？”，你回答“I can't quite make it out”（我不太能看清那是什么）。
- **听觉场景**：指“听不清、辨不明声音/话语”，比如嘈杂环境中的对话、模糊的电话声音等。  
  例：电话信号不好，对方说话模糊，你说“I can't quite make it out”（我不太能听清你说的话）。
- **理解场景**：指“弄不懂、理不清内容”，比如复杂的说明、混乱的逻辑等。  
  例：看一篇难懂的报告，你和同事说“I can't quite make it out”（我不太能弄明白这份报告的内容）。


2. 句子结构拆解
| 成分                | 语法作用                | 含义与用法说明                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| I                   | 主语                    | 第一人称，明确动作发出者是“我”          |
| can't quite make out | 谓语部分（情态动词+副词+动词短语） | - “can't”：表“不能、无法”，否定能力；<br>- “quite”：表“完全、彻底”，此处修饰“can't”，强调“不是完全不能，只是不太能”（语气较委婉）；<br>- “make out”：固定短语，核心义“识别、辨认、理解”（需结合场景） |
| it                  | 宾语                    | 指代前文提及的具体事物（如“that thing”“the sound”“the text”等），避免重复，翻译时需根据上下文补充具体指代对象（如“那东西”“那声音”） |


3. 同义表达（按场景分类）

| 场景         | 同义句                                  | 语气差异                          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 视觉场景     | I can't really see it clearly.          | 更直白，直接强调“看不清楚”，无“努力辨认”的隐含义 |
| 视觉场景     | I can barely make it out.               | 语气更强，“barely”表“几乎不能”，比“can't quite”更强调“困难程度” |
| 听觉场景     | I can't quite hear it clearly.          | 直接点明“听不清”，比原句更明确感官类型 |
| 听觉场景     | The sound is too faint for me to make out. | 补充“声音微弱”的原因，逻辑更完整 |
| 理解场景     | I can't quite figure it out.            | 更口语化，“figure out”侧重“通过思考弄明白”，替换“make out” |
| 理解场景     | I can't quite get my head around it.    | 更生活化（非正式），强调“难以理解、绕不过弯”，适合日常对话 |


4. 常见误区提醒
- 勿直译“make out”：“make out”不是“制造出”（字面义），此处是固定短语，需结合“识别/理解”的核心义翻译，避免误译为“我不太能制造出它”；
- “it”不可省略：原句中“it”是宾语，必须保留（指代前文事物），若省略为“I can't quite make out”，句子语法不完整（缺宾语），需补充具体指代对象（如“it”“what you said”）；
- “quite”的语气：此处“quite”表“完全”（用于否定句），而非“相当”（用于肯定句，如“He's quite tall”），“can't quite”意为“不太能、不能完全”，而非“相当不能”。

quite 在句子中的含义与用法解析

“quite” 是英语中常用的副词，核心含义需结合 **句子的肯定/否定语境、搭配的词性（形容词/副词/名词）** 来判断，主要分为以下4种核心用法，每种用法均附具体场景和例句，帮助你精准理解：

一、肯定句中：表“相当、很”（强调程度，介于“有点”和“非常”之间）

这是 “quite” 最常见的用法，用于修饰形容词、副词或动词，表达“程度较高但未到极致”，语气比 “a little”（有点）强，比 “very”（非常）弱，日常口语和书面语均常用。  

- **搭配形容词/副词**：直接置于形容词/副词前。  
  例句1：The code is quite complex.（这段代码相当复杂。）—— 修饰形容词 “complex”，表“代码有一定复杂度，但未到‘极其复杂’的程度”。  
  例句2：He runs quite fast.（他跑得相当快。）—— 修饰副词 “fast”，表“速度不错，但未到‘最快’级别”。  
- **搭配动词**：置于实义动词前，强调“动作的程度或频率”。  
  例句：I quite enjoy programming in Go.（我相当喜欢用Go语言编程。）—— 修饰动词 “enjoy”，表“喜欢的程度较高，但未到‘痴迷’”。

二、否定句中：表“完全、彻底”（强调“未达成完全状态”）

当 “quite” 用于 “can’t quite...”“don’t quite...” 等否定结构时，含义会从“相当”转变为“完全”，核心是“不能完全做到某事、未彻底达成目标”，语气委婉，不强调“完全做不到”，而是“差一点、未彻底”。  
这也是我们之前对话中 “I can't quite make it out” 里 “quite” 的含义（原句译为“我不太能看清楚/辨认出来”，本质是“不能完全辨认出来”）。  

- 例句1：I can’t quite understand this Redis command.（我不太能完全理解这个Redis命令。）—— 表“理解了一部分，但未彻底搞懂”。  
- 例句2：She doesn’t quite finish the task.（她没完全完成这项任务。）—— 表“做了大部分，但差一点没彻底完成”。

三、修饰“褒义形容词”时：表“非常、极其”（程度接近“very”）

当 “quite” 搭配 “nice”“good”“wonderful” 等 **褒义形容词** 时，程度会加强，相当于“非常”，带有积极的强调意味，此时语气比“相当”更强。  

- 例句1：The solution you provided is quite good.（你提供的解决方案非常好。）—— 此处“quite good”=“very good”，表强烈肯定。  
- 例句2：It’s quite wonderful to work with you.（和你一起工作非常愉快。）—— “quite wonderful”=“very wonderful”，强调愉悦程度。

四、修饰“名词”时：表“还算、相当数量的”（强调“数量或程度尚可”）

“quite” 还可直接修饰名词（需搭配 “a/an”，结构为 “quite a/an + 名词”），含义为“还算不错的、相当数量的”，既不夸大也不贬低，语气中立。  

- 修饰可数名词单数（quite a/an + 名词）：  
  例句：He has quite a lot of experience in database management.（他在数据库管理方面有相当多的经验。）—— 表“经验数量不少”。  
- 修饰不可数名词（quite + 名词）：  
  例句：There’s quite some time left before the deadline.（距离截止日期还有还算充足的时间。）—— 表“时间足够用，不算紧张”。


总结：快速判断“quite”含义的3个技巧
1. **看句式**：否定句（can’t quite/don’t quite）→ 表“完全”；肯定句→ 表“相当/非常”（需结合形容词褒贬）。  
2. **看搭配**：搭配褒义形容词（good/nice）→ 表“非常”；搭配中性/贬义形容词（complex/difficult）→ 表“相当”。  
3. **看语境**：日常对话中多表“相当”（程度适中）；正式评价中搭配褒义词时多表“非常”（强调肯定）。  

通过以上分类，你可以根据具体句子的语境快速锁定 “quite” 的准确含义，避免理解偏差。

翻译：The lowest score in tennis is love.

网球比赛中的最低分是零分（love）。

补充说明（深入理解术语背景与用法）：

1. **核心术语解析**：  
   句中 **love** 并非“爱”的本义，而是网球运动中的专属计分术语，特指“零分”。这是英语中极具场景性的一词多义，必须结合“网球计分”语境理解，否则会完全偏离原意。

2. **术语来源（帮助记忆）**：  
   “love”表示“零分”的起源尚无完全定论，但最广泛接受的说法与法语有关：  
   法语中“鸡蛋”是 **l'oeuf**，其发音与“love”接近，而鸡蛋的形状酷似数字“0”，因此被用来比喻“零分”，后来逐渐演变为英语网球术语中的“love”。

3. **相关常用搭配（场景化应用）**：  
   网球计分体系特殊，需掌握与“love”配套的基础比分表达，避免在实际交流中混淆：  
   - 0分：love  
   - 15分：fifteen  
   - 30分：thirty  
   - 40分：forty  
   - 平分（40-40）：deuce  
   - 占先（平分后领先1分）：advantage  

   例句：  
   - The score is **love-fifteen**.（比分是零比十五。）  
   - She won the game from **love-all** (0-0) to 6-4.（她从比分零比零开始，以6比4赢得了这局比赛。）
