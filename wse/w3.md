So he's called the police!
I'll have to go immediately!
Take it easy. Marco; I'm only joking.

A dangerous man has just escaped from prison.
He is a criminal.
He is wearing a red t-shirt and blue jeans.
Be careful if you see this dangerous person. He might steal your money.
Or, he might even kill you!
If you see anyone who looks like this man, call the cops!
It makes me nervous that there is a dangerous man on the streets.
I'm not a criminal, but I don't want any trouble with the police.

He must be the stupidest man I've ever met.

Now I can go back to sleep again.

Good evening, everybody. This is the nine o'clock news.
There has been an escape from Sing Song high security prison. The prison superintendent said the escape happened after dinner yesterday evening.
One of the prisoners complained about the food, and then attacked a prison guard. He then took the guard's keys and used them to open the prison gates.
An Interstate highway passes a few hundred yards from the prison, and police believe that the escaped prisoner then stopped a car and traveled(前往) to New York.
The man's name is Roger Pettri, he is very dangerous and probably has a gun. He is about one meter 92 tall, with blond hair and blue eyes, and speaks with a Canadian accent.
The police say that he is wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.

Where is Lara? in a neighborhood store.
How does what customers spend at this store compare to stores in other places in the United States? They spend more.
How often do men usually come into the store? usually before important days like Christmas.
What is a reason that people like to shop in this store? The store has things that are different from other stores.
Why does one woman like to shop with her friends? She can spend time with them.


This is a neighborhood boutique, a clothing and houseware store.
It's not the type of store you'd find at a large shopping mall.
Our customers purchase very practical items
They're not as trend-driven as you would find at a shopping mall.
I've got to buy a gift for my wife, and that's tough to do.
My wife's a very picky woman.
But in this place I can rely the women to help me out.
Then I look like a hero when my wife opens up the box.
It's almost like an all_ gallery.

We see men only a couple of times a year, the day before Christmas, the day before thincylen___times, and the day before Mothers' day.
They're very uncomfortable in the shopping domain.

Brithdays, anniversaries, Christmas, Valentine's Day, I can't stand it(我受不了了).

This is clealy the type of store where people buy things they want, not necessarily practical things they need.

They store__ come racing in, and they look nervous.
They actually fla___
but most part_ , men really don't like to shop that much.
I'm good types_ that when I find something that works.
then I want to buy it in three colors.
And we like the aformation__ of people liking the way you look.
It's a thrill(激动)!
Everyone always feels a little bit better when they have something new.
They buy clothing for themselves_,
and they just have fun.

The average sale here at out store is very high, probably much higher than a lot of regions in the United States.
We try to acknowledge each customer as they come in the store.
So why shop here instead of shopping at a mall?
There's always something a little bit unusual.


My parent's wedding anniversary is next week. They have been married for forty years.
He bought his girlfriend flowers for Valentine's Day.
Tina just had a bady. She will celebrate her fist Mother's Day in May.
It's December already? There are only a few days left until Christmas!
He's having a big party for his 18th birthday.
Unbelievable! What kind of person would steal a Halloween pumpkin?

They bought an expensive Van Dyck pictrue at a gallery.
She bought some things for her kitchen at the housewares store.
Steaks are much more expensive at a restaurant than at a supermarket.
To find very special or unusual things, you have to go to a boutique.
He saw a 200-year-old desk at the antique shop, but he couldn't afford it.
I don't like to buy things that I can't use a lot. I like to buy things that are very practical.
Teenagers are much more trend-driven than their parents when they shop.
His wife is very picky about what she buys. It has to be exactly right!

He's very uncomfortable buying clothes for his wife because he doesn't know her size or the colors she likes.
When his wife opens her gift box, he wants to be a hero, not a zero(毫无价值、让人失望的人)!
He has to rely on other women to help him find a good gift for his girlfriend.
Men often wait until the day before a birthday to go shopping for a gift.
She's got to buy Christmas gifts for her husband's family, and that's tough to do.
His wife likes pretty things, but he prefers practical items.
It's the type of store where people buy things they want, not necessarily things they want.
It's hard to walk into that store and leave empty-handed because they have so many great items!

WELLCOME TO HARRY'S SHOPPER'S PARADISE(天堂)!
Where can you get a large tropical(热带的) snake, an antique piano, a loaf(条) of bread, a haircut, the best in brand-name clothing and a wonderful choice of fresh-made pasta-all under the same roof?
At Harry's, of course!
WHO SHOPS AT HARRY'S?
The top celebrities in New York are good customers, but we have millions of other customers, and our friendly assistants treat each one of them like royalty(皇室). And that's not easy, when we have to look after 50,000 customers every day of the year and as many as 300,000 customers on the first day of the bargain(特价，廉价) sales!
IS HARRY'S EXPENSIVE?
Well, that depends on how much you want to spend. The most money ever spent by just one customer in a signle visit to Harry's was three million two hundred thousand dollars, and he paid the bill in cash. Not all our shoppers have that much money to spend, though. A lot of the things we sell are very good value and, of course, the best quality.
WHERE CAN YOU GET SOMETHING FOR THE MAN/WOMAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING?
In our special gift department that's where! At Christmas time we have a special gift department where all the presents cost more than one thousand dollars. But if you can't afford something really special, you can be sure to find a wonderful gift in our other department. Why not buy your loved one a Christmas fruitcake? They are one of the most popular buys at Christmas time - we sell over 120 tons of Christmas fruitcakes every year.
YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE USA, BUT YOU WANT TO SHOP AT HARRY'S?
No problem - many of our customers are overseas visitors, and we have a very fash and efficient export service. We will transport anything from our store to any city in the world. Nothing is too big or too small for our attention(关注，注意力). Last year we flew half a kilo of Harry's best sausages to a boat in the Mediterranean, and six bread rolls to a customer in Hollywood. We also exported a Persian carpet(波斯地毯) to Iran and a fridge to Finland!
WHERE CAN YOU FIND US?
Harry's is on Fifth Avenue in the heart of New York's best shopping area. The nearest subway station are the No.3 or D line(42nd Steet Station). See you soon!

Dear Tony,
May I call you Tony? I've been a fan yours ever since I was only 15. I've bought all your CDs, and I think you're absolutely fantastic.
I thought "A Man Alone" was amazing, and "You're Gonna Be Someone" is ever better. What a pity I haven't got a CD play anymore!
This is the reason I'm writing to you, I've just found this amazing new group. I can't quite remember their name, but I know they really like your records.
I wonder if you could help me, I'm their manager, by the way by getting us a recording contract with your company.
Please let me know as soon as possible the contract is ready. You can't call me, I'm afraid, because I haven't got a phone anymore, but you can always write to me. I can't wait to hear from you.
Yours sincerely(真诚地), John Berry.

Please let me know as soon as the contract is ready.
You can't call me, but you can always write to me.

He'll look for a new apartment when he returns from Europe.
He can drink beer when he is 21 years old.
I'll see Heidi when I go to Swizerland.
Say hello to Pat when you see him.
Can you give Sally the package when she comes?

I've been a fan of Tony Moroni's ever since I was only 15.
I've bought all your CDs, and I think you're absolutely fantastic.
Can you get us a record contract with your company?
Well, I've chosen, I'm going to the top.

We sell dreams to losers, it's a great business.
If you want to sing with a rock bank, put an ad in the music store.

Dear Bo-Bae,
I'm writing to you from Riverbank Park, by the side of the Hudson River. I've come here with the other students from the English class for a picnic, it's a beautiful day, and the sun is shining!
We have just had lunch, I wanted sandwiches made with white bread, but the other students ate them all, so I had to ate brown bread. I complained to the teacher, but he just laughed.
Perhaps he was thinking about love. He's just got engaged to one of the students, a Mexician girl. She's a very pleasent and resonable girl, and I'm sure they'll be happy together.
I spoke to the director of the school yesterday, by the way, to ask him how much longer I needed to stay there.
He told me that I needed to stay another couple of years if I wanted to speak English really well. He also said that I could take extra private lessons if I wanted to for $150 an hour. It's a bit expensive really, I'm not sure what to do.
Anyway, I'll be home at the end of next month for the summer vacation. I'll see you then.
Your loving husband, Kim

You make very few mistakes in grammar when you speak.
David taught it in yeasterday's lesson and she has forgotten it already.
I don't think he is in love with her; I think she is making him marry her.
I am in Budapest. I have come here on a business trip.
I am not hungry, I have just had lunch.
My boss told me that I needed to imporve my English if I wanted to make more money.
He drove her to work when her car was broken.
I don't think my teacher is very nice. Yesterday, he laughed at a student's pronunciation.

Riverbank Park is by the side of the Hudson River.
They took a boat to the island.
Meet me at the entrance to the park in two hours.
There's a nice place to see the whole city on the top of hill.
It's too cold to swim in that lake!
Take off your shoes and walk on the gress, It feels great!
England is nice, but it rains too much.
It's such a nice day. We should have a picnic at the park.

Where is Gabe? at a university.
Why is the man studying Japanese? He's interested in Japan and the language.
When did the woman start studying Spanish? in high school.
How long do the students at the university have to learn a new language? four.
Why does one man think that Americans have a hard time learning language? Americans are not near many other language.
Why does one woman think that Chinese is going to be such an important language? because most of the people in the would are Chinese.


We're on the campus of Georgetown University, talking about studying foreign languages.
So when I got to seventh grade, I had to choose a foreign language to study in school.
So when I got here, I decided to become a double major_.

I would consider myself professioned__

I chose Japanese mainly because I'm interested in Japanese culture and language.
I'm Chinese myself, my parents are from Hong Kong, so I was brought up listening to Cantonese.
I decide to learn Mandarin.
I started studying Spanish in high school because my father's s Puerto Rican, and I considered it part of my heritage.
I picked Russian because I wanted to learn a more challenging language.
The idea of being able to go to a place and speak to the people in their native language, is really cool.

Given the various techniques there are to learn a language, which do you prefer: classroom or online?
The good thing is to have multiple sources of information.
The most important thing is that the students should be familiar with the avalible resources.
Is it difficult to teach a foreign languge to American students?
Not at all, they're highly motivated(积极主动) and hard-working.
Are you saying that four years is not enough time to lean a language?
It depends on the student's goal: if they want to be fluent in Japanese, to be at an advanced level.

We're an isolated country, with very few foreign languages spoken adjacent to us.
I think a big part of it is that you need to stay motivated.

In Europe it's a lot easier to go across borders and hear a foreign language spoken.
As you can see(如你所见) and as you know(如你所知), it takes a lot of dedication to master a foreign language.
So Stick with it. It is well worth it.


Georgetown University has a very large campus in Washington,DC.
He left school in the tenth grade.
She plans to major(主修) in Business when she goes to college.
The town is growing so fast that there are not enough classrooms in the schools.
The school is very good. The students study languages to a very advanced level.
Students can find many resources by using the university computers.
My teacher is very dynamic. She not only is helpful in class, but we can also contact her online.

Even though my parents speak Italian, I wasn't brought up speaking Italian. That's why I'm studying it now.
His father is Puerto Rican, so he considers Spanish part of his heritage.
She wants to study a more challenging language, like Japanese.
Englishi is considered to be the common language in business.
He studies languages because he likes meeting people from other places and cultures.
She's familiar with the Cyrillic(西里尔的) alphabet, but she doesn't speak Russian.
To learn a new language, you must be hard-working and have a lot of dedication.

It's better to have multiple sources of information.
She's living in Chicago, but she's taking a class online from the University of Berlin.
There are various techniques to learn a language besides going to a classroom.
Are any of the university computers avalible? I need to check something online.
Book and CDs are some of the resources you can use to learn a new language.
She's proficient in Russian grammar, but her pronumciation is terrible!

Mastering Asian Languages
The number one reason students of Asian languages quit before they become fluent is frustration. For the dedicated student of Chinese of Japanese, my obstacles must be overcome before they can become even a little fluent.
Chinese and Japanese Are Harder: For English speakers, Chinese and Japanese are much harder to master than European languages. The English language and culture share common roots with the European languages and cultrues. Chinese and Japanese, however, have very different sentence structures and are based on very different cultual assumptions. For example, a simple idea in English or Japanese could require a paragraph in the other language.
Learning Thousands of Characters Comes before Listening and Speaking: The ablility to recognize, interpret and pronounce thousands of Chinese characters-each individually challenging to learn and remember - is essential for proficiency. Asians spend years learning their own language， Traditional Asian education focuses on learning of lots of facts by memory. Chinese character writing and reading are taught based on a system that introduces specific characters in each new school year.
However, learning many facts of characters is no longer done in U.S. education. Most Americans have not practiced memorization since learning math. This situation leaves the Asian language students upprepared for studying Asian languages. They are not used to interested in spending long hours memorizing Chinese characters. So many students quit their study of Asian languages because they Can't master their wirtten forms.
Asian Language Learning is Slower: After one year of study, an English -speaking student of German, Spanish of French would be able to speak a little in the language and read and write letters with a dictionary. But even with hard work, a students of Chinese of Japanse man not be able to do this. An Asian language student may not be able to recognize enough charactoers and may not yet be able to use a dictionary.
Difficulties of Chinese: First, Chinese uses several sounds not found in English that English speakers must learn. Also, Chinese use tones(the pitch at which a syllable is spoken) much more than other languages do. Mandarin uses five tones, and Cantonese use nine different tones! Also, there are two sets of Chinese characters: traditional and simplified. Taiwan and Hong Kong use the Traditional Chinese character set, while mainland China uses a newer, simplified set.
Difficulties of Japanese: Because the Japanese adapted Chinese writing to a completely different spoken language, Japanese writing is even more difficult to master than Chinese writing. And the student who is hoping for fluency must also learn other grammatical rules of the Japanese languge. For example, Japanese uses a reverse word order to make complicated sentences. Long phrases are used to change words that may be a part of other phrases. Also as a spoken language, Japanese uses fewer sounds than English, which make repetitive and confusing sound combinations. For example, imagine hearing the defferent between "atatatakatada" from "attakatada". Finally, Japanese is highly inflected(words change form) based on the status of the speaker, listener and the subject of the conversation, as well as "politeness level"
Asian Find it Hard, Too: Additionally, calligraphy is a primary part of Japanese and Chinese education. At an early age, Chinese and Japanese children learn to draw characters that fit into a box on a fixed grid page. Well-drawn and "beautiful" characters are appreciated by almost every native speaker.
Educational Problems: Japanese and Chinese texts teach the language in an old fashioned style, like "the pen of my aunt is on the table of my uncle." This same technique makes it difficult for Asian students of English because their traditional language instruction concentrates on the written a language and grammar rules. The result: most native Japanese can not speak much English at all, even after five of more years of intense English study.

What is the main reason that students of Asian language stop studying before they can speak the language? frustration.
What is the learning focus of traditional Asian education? memory.
Why does it take longer to learn an Asian language than a European language? Students have to learn a lot of characters.
What is one reason why Chinese is so hard for English speakers to learn? It has sounds that English does not have.
What makes Japanese sentences so difficult? The word order is reversed.
What is one reason why spoken Japanese is hard for English speakers? A lot of the sounds are repeated.
When do Chinese and Japanese native speakers begin learning to write? when they are children.
Why can't most native Japanese speak much English even after studying it for years? They spend more time leaning the rules of the language than speaking.

If the train is on schedule it will arrive at 10:27.
They will celebrate their anniversary at a nice restaurant.
She is fluent in three languages.
He did badly in the class because he wasn't really motivated to learn.

Don't talk on your mobile while you are driving! It's dangerous.
The cake is made with two cups of sugar.

伴随状语的核心作用，就是用一个短语来描述“主句动作发生时，同时存在的另一个动作或状态”，让句子信息更丰富、逻辑更连贯。

一、核心定义与作用
伴随状语本身不是独立句子，而是依附于主句的补充成分。它主要用来回答两个问题：

1. 主句动作发生时，**主语同时在做什么**（伴随动作）。比如“He sat there reading a book”，“reading a book”就是伴随状语，说明“他坐着”的同时“在看书”。
2. 主句动作发生时，**主语处于什么状态**（伴随状态）。比如“She ran out of the room crying”，“crying”是伴随状语，说明“她跑出去”时“在哭”的状态。

二、常见表现形式
日常使用中，伴随状语最常见的有3种形式，其中“现在分词/过去分词”是高频考点：
1. **现在分词（doing）**：当伴随动作与主句动作是“同一个主语主动发出”时使用。
   - 例：They walked along the street **singing happily**（他们沿街走，同时开心地唱歌）。
2. **过去分词（done）**：当伴随状态是“主语被动承受”时使用。
   - 例：The letter came **written in English**（信寄来了，信上是用英文写的）。
3. **介词短语**：用“with/without+名词”的结构，描述伴随的物品或状态。
   - 例：He left the office **with a smile**（他笑着离开了办公室）。

三、关键使用要点
1. 逻辑主语一致：伴随状语的逻辑主语，必须和主句的主语是同一个，否则句子会有歧义。比如“Standing by the window, she watched the rain”，“Standing”的主语就是主句的“she”，逻辑一致。
2. 与主句动作同时性：伴随状语描述的动作/状态，必须和主句动作“同时发生”，不能有明显的先后顺序。

解释一下：We're going to have to move fast.

这句话语法正确、表达自然，核心是“我们必须得快点行动”，传递出一种“时间紧迫、需要立刻加快节奏”的紧迫感，常用于计划或执行任务的场景。

1. 核心含义与使用场景
句子通过“be going to + have to”的结构，强调“客观情况或当下需求迫使我们必须提速”，而非主观意愿，常见场景包括：
- 赶时间时，比如“离火车发车只剩10分钟了，我们得快点行动”。
- 应对紧急情况时，比如“暴雨马上要来了，我们得赶紧把户外的东西搬进来”。
- 推进任务时，比如“项目截止日期快到了，我们必须加快进度”。

2. 关键结构解析
句子的核心是“be going to have to do sth.”，这个结构专门用于表达“未来需要被迫做某事”，比单纯的“have to”更强调“即将到来的必要性”：
- **be going to**：表“计划或即将发生的动作”，说明“加快行动”是接下来要做的事。
- **have to**：表“客观需要、不得不”，强化“必须提速”的必要性，而非可选的选择。
- 谓语动词“move fast”：字面是“快速移动”，此处结合语境泛指“快速行动、加快进度”，是口语中常用的简洁表达。

3. 语气特点
这句话整体语气偏严肃、直接，没有委婉感，适合在需要统一节奏、推动行动的场合使用，能让对方清晰感受到“时间不等人，必须立刻行动”的信号。
