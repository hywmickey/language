Or, he might even kill you!
If you see anyone who looks like this man, call the cops!

There has been an escape from Sing Song high security prison. The prison superintendent said the escape happened after dinner yesterday evening.
One of the prisoners complained about the food, and then attacked a prison guard. He then took the guard's keys and used them to open the prison gates.
An Interstate highway passes a few hundred yards from the prison, and police believe that the escaped prisoner then stopped a car and traveled(前往) to New York.
The man's name is Roger Pettri, he is very dangerous and probably has a gun. He is about one meter 92 tall, with blond hair and blue eyes, and speaks with a Canadian accent.
The police say that he is wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
