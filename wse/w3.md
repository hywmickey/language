So he's called the police!
I'll have to go immediately!
Take it easy. Marco; I'm only joking.

A dangerous man has just escaped from prison.
He is a criminal.
He is wearing a red t-shirt and blue jeans.
Be careful if you see this dangerous person. He might steal your money.
Or, he might even kill you!
If you see anyone who looks like this man, call the cops!
It makes me nervous that there is a dangerous man on the streets.
I'm not a criminal, but I don't want any trouble with the police.

He must be the stupidest man I've ever met.

Now I can go back to sleep again.

Good evening, everybody. This is the nine o'clock news.
There has been an escape from Sing Song high security prison. The prison superintendent said the escape happened after dinner yesterday evening.
One of the prisoners complained about the food, and then attacked a prison guard. He then took the guard's keys and used them to open the prison gates.
An Interstate highway passes a few hundred yards from the prison, and police believe that the escaped prisoner then stopped a car and traveled(前往) to New York.
The man's name is Roger Pettri, he is very dangerous and probably has a gun. He is about one meter 92 tall, with blond hair and blue eyes, and speaks with a Canadian accent.
The police say that he is wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.

Where is Lara? in a neighborhood store.
How does what customers spend at this store compare to stores in other places in the United States? They spend more.
How often do men usually come into the store? usually before important days like Christmas.
What is a reason that people like to shop in this store? The store has things that are different from other stores.
Why does one woman like to shop with her friends? She can spend time with them.


This is a neighborhood boutique, a clothing and houseware store.
It's not the type of store you'd find at a large shopping mall.
Our customers purchase very practical items
They're not as trend-driven as you would find at a shopping mall.
I've got to buy a gift for my wife, and that's tough to do.
My wife's a very picky woman.
But in this place I can rely the women to help me out.
Then I look like a hero when my wife opens up the box.
It's almost like an all_ gallery.

We see men only a couple of times a year, the day before Christmas, the day before thincylen___times, and the day before Mothers' day.
They're very uncomfortable in the shopping domain.

Brithdays, anniversaries, Christmas, Valentine's Day, I can't stand it(我受不了了).

This is clealy the type of store where people buy things they want, not necessarily practical things they need.

They store__ come racing in, and they look nervous.
They actually fla___
but most part_ , men really don't like to shop that much.
I'm good types_ that when I find something that works.
then I want to buy it in three colors.
And we like the aformation__ of people liking the way you look.
It's a thrill(激动)!
Everyone always feels a little bit better when they have something new.
They buy clothing for themselves_,
and they just have fun.

The average sale here at out store is very high, probably much higher than a lot of regions in the United States.
We try to acknowledge each customer as they come in the store.
So why shop here instead of shopping at a mall?
There's always something a little bit unusual.


My parent's wedding anniversary is next week. They have been married for forty years.
He bought his girlfriend flowers for Valentine's Day.
Tina just had a bady. She will celebrate her fist Mother's Day in May.
It's December already? There are only a few days left until Christmas!
He's having a big party for his 18th birthday.
Unbelievable! What kind of person would steal a Halloween pumpkin?

They bought an expensive Van Dyck pictrue at a gallery.
She bought some things for her kitchen at the housewares store.
Steaks are much more expensive at a restaurant than at a supermarket.
To find very special or unusual things, you have to go to a boutique.
He saw a 200-year-old desk at the antique shop, but he couldn't afford it.
I don't like to buy things that I can't use a lot. I like to buy things that are very practical.
Teenagers are much more trend-driven than their parents when they shop.
His wife is very picky about what she buys. It has to be exactly right!

He's very uncomfortable buying clothes for his wife because he doesn't know her size or the colors she likes.
When his wife opens her gift box, he wants to be a hero, not a zero(毫无价值、让人失望的人)!
He has to rely on other women to help him find a good gift for his girlfriend.
Men often wait until the day before a birthday to go shopping for a gift.
She's got to buy Christmas gifts for her husband's family, and that's tough to do.
His wife likes pretty things, but he prefers practical items.
It's the type of store where people buy things they want, not necessarily things they want.
It's hard to walk into that store and leave empty-handed because they have so many great items!

WELLCOME TO HARRY'S SHOPPER'S PARADISE(天堂)!
Where can you get a large tropical(热带的) snake, an antique piano, a loaf(条) of bread, a haircut, the best in brand-name clothing and a wonderful choice of fresh-made pasta-all under the same roof?
At Harry's, of course!
WHO SHOPS AT HARRY'S?
The top celebrities in New York are good customers, but we have millions of other customers, and our friendly assistants treat each one of them like royalty(皇室). And that's not easy, when we have to look after 50,000 customers every day of the year and as many as 300,000 customers on the first day of the bargain(特价，廉价) sales!
IS HARRY'S EXPENSIVE?
Well, that depends on how much you want to spend. The most money ever spent by just one customer in a signle visit to Harry's was three million two hundred thousand dollars, and he paid the bill in cash. Not all our shoppers have that much money to spend, though. A lot of the things we sell are very good value and, of course, the best quality.
WHERE CAN YOU GET SOMETHING FOR THE MAN/WOMAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING?
In our special gift department that's where! At Christmas time we have a special gift department where all the presents cost more than one thousand dollars. But if you can't afford something really special, you can be sure to find a wonderful gift in our other department. Why not buy your loved one a Christmas fruitcake? They are one of the most popular buys at Christmas time - we sell over 120 tons of Christmas fruitcakes every year.
YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE USA, BUT YOU WANT TO SHOP AT HARRY'S?
No problem - many of our customers are overseas visitors, and we have a very fash and efficient export service. We will transport anything from our store to any city in the world. Nothing is too big or too small for our attention(关注，注意力). Last year we flew half a kilo of Harry's best sausages to a boat in the Mediterranean, and six bread rolls to a customer in Hollywood. We also exported a Persian carpet(波斯地毯) to Iran and a fridge to Finland!

Dear Tony,
May I call you Tony? I've been a fan yours ever since I was only 15. I've bought all your CDs, and I think you're absolutely fantastic.
I thought "A Man Alone" was amazing, and "You're Gonna Be Someone" is ever better. What a pity I haven't got a CD play anymore!
This is the reason I'm writing to you, I've just found this amazing new group. I can't quite remember their name, but I know they really like your records.
I wonder if you could help me, I'm their manager, by the way by getting us a recording contract with your company.
Please let me know as soon as possible the contract is ready. You can't call me, I'm afraid, because I haven't got a phone anymore, but you can always write to me. I can't wait to hear from you.
Yours sincerely(真诚地), John Berry.

Please let me know as soon as the contract is ready.
You can't call me, but you can always write to me.
Call me when you decide.
He'll see her when he gets out of prison.
He'll look for a new apartment when he returns from Europe.
He can drink beer when he is 21 years old.
I'll see Heidi when I go to Swizerland.
Say hello to Pat when you see him.
Can you give Sally the package when she comes?

I've been a fan of Tony Moroni's ever since I was only 15.
I've bought all your CDs, and I think you're absolutely fantastic.
Can you get us a record contract with your company?
Well, I've chosen, I'm going to the top.

We sell dreams to losers, it's a great business.
If you want to sing with a rock bank, put an ad in the music store.
They're a good band, but they can't get a contract with a record company.
I'd love to hear that band paly live!
Since he started managing our band, we've had the chance to play live in a lot of places.
