NEW YORK CITY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES CONSULTATION REPORT NAME OF PATIENT: Mrs. Susan Petri
Mrs. Petri, who is a patient of Dr. Hargreaves, come to see me complaining that she could not get to sleep.
Dr. Hargreaves had explained to me that, in his opinion, she had psychological problems, and needed to talk to a pyschiatric professional.
As far as I can see, Mrs. Petri is not yet ready to talk about her problems openly.
I offered her the chance to do so, but she chose instead to tell me a long story about detectives and prisoners, of which I found it very difficult to understand more than a small part.
Like many lonely people, she probably watches too much television, and has difficulty in telling the difference between crime movies and the reality of her own life.
When Mr.s Petri left my office she said that she was perfectly all right, and did not even accept my offer of a prescription for sleeping pills.
I do not think she is in any immediate danger, but I would advise Dr.Hargreaves to keep a close eye on her.
Maureen Cranston.

The prescription that I have is out of date, so I can't use it.
Is there anything else which could stop you from sleeping?
Your fiance is trying to catch you husband who's escaped from prision. Is that right?
Dr. Cranston, who is a well-know pyschiatrist, is a very understanding person.
Mrs. Petri, whos is a patient of Dr. Hargreaves, came to see me complaining that she couldn't get to sleep.
Dr. Hargreaves, who knows her well, said that Mrs. Petri had pyschological problems.
She told me a long stroy, which I found very difficult to understand.
When Mrs. Petri left my office she didn't accept the prescription I offered her.
There are plenty of people who go to see psychiatrists, it dosn't mean you're crasy.
The only thing I don't understand is why she didn't give me a prescription.
