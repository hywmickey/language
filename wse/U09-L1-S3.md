I'm back in New York!
Yes, I want to see Ms. Helen Sisay.
She can't see you now, she's busy.
Look, I'm just back from Paris.
Are you free this evening?
I can come to your apartment.
Harry, I'm busy! I'm at work.
I'm sorry, but I don't want to see you again.

That's $87.50.
How much!?
Eighty-seven fifty.
There's a $70 fare, plus $15 extra for the airport, plus...
Oh, it dosen't matter! Here you are!

Wait here, please.
Hello, Helen, love! Nice to see you.
Excuse me a moument, Terry.
No problem, Helen.
Take your time.

The XYZ studio, on Eighth Avenue and 77th Street.
It's very important!
I'm a friend of hers.
Listen Harry, I have a new boyfriend now.

Wait a minute, don't I know you? 
Oh, no, no! No you don't. 
What dose he want?
I don't know.
Do you want to speak to him?
No, I don't!

Doesn't John want to come over? Yes, he does.
Don't the want to eat? No, they don't.

Good afternoon. This is Hugo Peter's office.
I want to speak to Mr. Peters.
Mr. Peters isn't in the office. Can I give him a message?
Can I have your name, please?
This is Jack Cooper.
Just a moment, Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Perters, there's someone on the phone.
Can I give him a message?

 I'm just back from Paris.
 On police business, or with your beautiful lady?
 Look at this! This poor guy comes to New York.
 That's interesting!
 No, you listen to me, Mr. Peters.
 We're in the newspapers now.
 
 Harry is friend of hers.
