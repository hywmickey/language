You can pay $100 a square foot there, or more.
那里的价格是每平方英尺 100 美元，甚至更高。
You can pay $100 a square foot：字面意为 “你可以付每平方英尺 100 美元”，中文习惯将价格单位前置，优化为 “每平方英尺 100 美元”（省略冗余主语 “你”，更符合价格描述的简洁性）。
a square foot（平方英尺）是英制面积单位

How much would we pay for a store of, say, 500 square meters?
如果租 / 买一间大约 500 平方米的商铺，我们需要支付多少钱？
a store of 500 square meters
of + 面积
结构：a + 物体 + of + 数字 + 面积单位 → 表示 “某面积的某物”
同义结构（更简洁）：数字 + 连字符 + 面积单位 + 物体（作定语，面积单位用单数）
👉 例句：a 500-square-meter store（= a store of 500 square meters）
面积单位缩写（商务常用）：sqm（square meters）、sqft（square feet），如：a 500-sqm store

Say, $600,000 a year in rent, plus city taxes, and realtor's fees, and brokerage fees.
租金方面，比如说每年 60 万美元，外加城市税、房地产经纪人费以及经纪佣金。
What are brokerage fees?
That's what you pay the broker who finds you the place.

If I understand correctly, this is exactly what you are looking for.
Not at $100 a square foot.
$100: a hundred doallors 
I could get the owners to reduce that, if you singed a longer lease.
If you sign a three-year lease you can have it for $80 a square foot.
lease: 租赁；(房屋、设备或土地的)租约，租契
That's around half million a year.
这大约是每年50万。
正确表达应为 That's around half a million a year.（漏了不定冠词 a），因为 half a million 是固定搭配（= 500,000），类似结构：half a dozen（半打，6 个）、half an hour（半小时）。
Shall we go back to the office and sign the paperwork?
我们回办公室签一下文件好吗?
paperwork: 文书工作；(诉讼案件、购置房产等所需的)全部文件，全部资料
I decided to take the place.
We can have it for half a million, if we sign a three-year lease.

It seems like you're making all the decisions by yourself.
I need to know that I can depend on you.
我需要知道我可以依靠你。
I need to know that I can trust you to take the right decisions.
So you're kind of testing me, are you?
所以你这算是在试探我，是吧？

我会负责保险和所有法律事务。
I'll leave you to get on with hiring staff and fitting out the store.

You have to pay brokerage costs to the person who finds you a space you like.
If we don't want to use a realtor to help us sell our place, we will have to sell it ourselves.
If you can commit to a one-year lease, we can lower the price.
如果您能签订一年期租约，我们可以降低租金。
commit to: 正式承诺、签订（合同 / 协议）、承担义务， 区别于日常的 “承诺”，强调法律 / 商业层面的约束力
搭配拓展（商务高频）：
    commit to a contract（签订合同）
    commit to a 3-year partnership（承诺 3 年合作）
    commit to monthly payments（承诺按月付款）
If you are ready to move in now, you can have it.
You have to pay taxes to the government.
There are many kinds of fees to pay the broker for his services.

I'll take care of the financial side and you take care of the marketing.
I'll leave you to do the rest.
剩下的就交给你了。

get on with doing sth：「继续做某事、着手独立完成某事」，侧重 “不中断、不依赖他人，自主推进”（区别于普通 “do sth”，强调 “持续性 + 独立性”）。

Let's talk
You are planing to visit the island of Malta, and you go to a travel agent to inquire about travel and visa arrangements. Ask the clerk:
- what means of transport are avaliable for travel to Malta(you would prefer to travel by sea, if it doesn't take too long).
- whether it's necessary to book a hotel before going there
- whether you need a visa for Malta, and
- whether it's possible to rent a mountain bilke there.
Sometimes you may feel that the clerk isn't sure about what she is telling you; in this case ask politely to check her information.

You are at the Malteses Embassy to find out if you need a visa and, if so, to get one.(You have brought your passport with you.) You would also like to know:
- whether you can get Maltese currency in your country. and,
- if so, how much Maltese currency you are allowed to bring into the country.
- Finally, ask the official if he is able to recommend you a hotel in Valletta(the capital of Malta)

You have checked in to your hotel in Valletta, and you would like the receptionist to give you some information about the hotel regulations.
Explain to her that you would like to have dinner sometimes out in the town, and sometimes in the hotel; ask if this is possible. 
Then ask if you can make overseas calls from the phone in your room.
Next, ask if the hotel has a business center with internet access and if your laptop will work there. 
Finnally, thank her for helping you.


The rents in this place are quite high.
If you sign a lease, you will get a better price.
We need to hire a broker to help us find the perfect place.
I work for a brokerage company which helps people find the right place.
Is it legal to charge that much?
There is so much demand for places in that area that it's really hard to find anything.
Our company has grown and now we need more space.
Look at the amount of paperwork we have to read and sign.
If you want to be successful, location is everything.
The price of this building is really high. How can we reduce it to something we can afford?
这栋建筑的价格实在太高了。我们怎样才能把价格降到我们能承受的范围呢？
“to something we can afford” 译为 “到我们能承受的范围”：“something” 指代 “价格水平”，中文用 “范围” 概括更自然，比直译 “降到我们能承受的东西” 更通顺；

You can't take that computer out of the country. The government doesn't allow people to export that.
You can bring the camera into the country. You just need to declare its value to customers.
你可以把相机带到国内。你只需要向客户声明它的价值。
You need to have a visa issued before you can enter that country.
You can't use American dollars in Europe. They use a different currency there.

插入语（Parenthetical Expression）全面解析  
（结合语法本质+场景应用+易错点，适配日常/商务英语需求）

一、核心定义与本质特征  
插入语是**插入句子中间、对内容起补充说明/语气调节作用的独立成分**，核心特征：  
1. 不充当句子主干（主谓宾/主系表），删除后句子语法依然完整、语义不变；  
2. 需用标点与主干隔离（逗号、破折号、括号），位置灵活（句首/句中/句尾）；  
3. 功能：补充信息、弱化语气、转换话题、表达态度（使语言更自然、精准）。

二、常见插入语分类（附场景例句）  
按形式和功能分为5大类，优先覆盖商务/日常高频用法：

| 类型                | 常见表达                          | 功能说明                          | 商务场景例句                                  | 日常场景例句                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1. 插入词（副词/连词） | say（比如）、maybe（或许）、indeed（确实）、however（然而）、therefore（因此） | 表举例、推测、转折、总结          | The contract, **say**, will be signed next week.（这份合同，比如，下周签署。） | We can, **maybe**, meet at 3 PM.（我们或许可以下午3点见。） |
| 2. 插入短语          | for example（例如）、on the other hand（另一方面）、as a matter of fact（事实上）、in my opinion（在我看来）、to be honest（老实说） | 表举例、对比、态度、补充说明      | The price, **for example**, is 10% lower than the market average.（比如，价格比市场均价低10%。） | **To be honest**, I don’t agree with the plan.（老实说，我不同意这个计划。） |
| 3. 插入从句          | I think（我认为）、I believe（我相信）、as far as I know（据我所知）、it is said（据说）、what’s more（此外） | 表观点、传闻、补充逻辑            | **As far as I know**, the project will start next month.（据我所知，项目下月启动。） | He is, **I think**, the best candidate for the job.（我认为他是这份工作的最佳人选。） |
| 4. 插入感叹词/呼语    | oh（哦）、well（好吧）、hey（嘿）、ladies and gentlemen（女士们先生们） | 表语气、打招呼、引起注意          | **Well**, let’s move on to the next agenda.（好吧，我们进入下一个议程。） | **Hey**, that’s a great idea!（嘿，这是个好主意！） |
| 5. 数字/时间/地点插入 | roughly（大约）、approximately（约）、in 2024（在2024年）、in Beijing（在北京） | 表估算、限定时间/地点（弱化绝对性） | The cost, **roughly**, is $50k.（费用大约是5万美元。） | We’ll have a meeting, **in the conference room**, at 10 AM.（我们上午10点在会议室开会。） |

三、关键语法规则（必掌握，避免出错）  
1. **标点使用规范**（核心易错点）  
   - 短插入语（1-2个词，如say、maybe、however）：前后用**逗号**隔离（句首/句尾可省略后/前逗号）：  
     ✅ She is, however, not available today.（她今天却没空。）  
     ✅ However, she is not available today.（句首逗号可加可不加，正式场景建议加）  
   - 长插入语（短语/从句）：前后用**逗号**，或用**破折号/括号**（强调/补充说明）：  
     ✅ The new policy（which takes effect next year）will benefit small businesses.（括号表补充，语气最弱）  
     ✅ The new policy—which takes effect next year—will benefit small businesses.（破折号表强调，语气更强）  
   - 呼语/感叹词：单独使用时用**感叹号**，插入句中用逗号：  
     ✅ Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the conference!（呼语开头用逗号）  
     ✅ Oh, I forgot to bring the document!（感叹词开头用逗号）

2. **位置灵活但不破坏主干**  
   插入语可放在主语后、谓语后、宾语后，但不能拆分固定搭配（如pay for、look forward to）：  
   ❌ We would pay, for, a 500-sqm store.（拆分了pay for，错误）  
   ✅ We would pay for a 500-sqm store, say, in the downtown area.（插入语放在句尾，不破坏搭配）  
   ✅ We, as planned, would pay for a 500-sqm store.（插入语放在主语后，正确）

3. **主谓一致不受插入语影响**  
   插入语中的成分不改变主句的主谓一致关系：  
   ✅ The team, including three experts, is working on the project.（主句主语是the team，谓语用单数is，插入语including不影响）  
   ❌ The team, including three experts, are working on the project.（错误）

四、商务场景高频插入语及替换（提升地道性）  
| 基础表达       | 商务升级表达                  | 应用场景                  | 例句                                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| say（比如）    | for instance / approximately  | 报价、估算时弱化绝对性    | The store, for instance, 500 sqm, costs $50k. |
| maybe（或许）  | presumably / potentially      | 预测风险、可能性          | Presumably, the deadline will be extended.    |
| I think（我认为）| from our perspective / we believe | 正式提案、观点陈述        | From our perspective, the plan is feasible.   |
| however（然而）| nevertheless / on the contrary | 反驳、转折观点            | Nevertheless, the cost exceeds our budget.    |
| in short（总之）| to summarize / in conclusion  | 会议总结、报告结尾        | To summarize, we need to adjust the schedule. |

五、易错点避雷（结合用户之前句子）  
1. 遗漏标点：  
   ❌ How much would we pay for a store of say 500 square meters?（say前后无逗号，错误）  
   ✅ How much would we pay for a store of, say, 500 square meters?（正确，插入语前后加逗号）  
2. 位置错误（拆分固定搭配）：  
   ❌ We would, pay for, a 500-sqm store.（拆分pay for，错误）  
   ✅ We would pay for, say, a 500-sqm store.（插入语放在宾语前，正确）  
3. 过度使用插入语：  
   ❌ The project, I think, maybe, will be finished, roughly, next month.（多个插入语堆砌，句子混乱）  
   ✅ I think the project will be finished roughly next month.（简化为一个插入语，更简洁）

六、实战应用：插入语让表达更自然  
- 原句（生硬）：The price is $100 per sqm. It may be higher.  
- 加插入语（自然）：The price is $100 per sqm, or higher, presumably.（价格每平方米100美元，或许还会更高。）  
- 原句（生硬）：We need to sign the contract. We should do it before Friday.  
- 加插入语（商务化）：We need to sign the contract, as a matter of fact, before Friday.（事实上，我们需要在周五前签署合同。）

通过插入语，英语表达能避免生硬直白，同时精准传递补充信息或语气，尤其适合商务沟通中“委婉咨询、灵活表述、补充说明”的需求，日常交流中也能让对话更自然流畅。

二、关键补充（用法拓展+语气说明）
1. **位置灵活度**：  
   - 后接形容词/动词时，放在系动词/情态动词后、实义动词前：  
     ✅ She is kind of shy.（系动词后） / ✅ He kind of likes the idea.（实义动词前）  
   - 后接名词时，需加 “a”（后接可数名词单数）：  
     ✅ It’s kind of a challenge.（= 算是个挑战） / ❌ It’s kind of challenge.（错误）

2. **语气特点**：  
   - 弱化表达强度，避免绝对化，让语气更委婉自然（日常/商务非正式场景通用）；  
   - 中文翻译可根据语境灵活切换“有点”“算是”“差不多”，无需拘泥于字面。

3. **同义替换（场景适配）**：  
   - 口语中可直接替换为 “sort of”（含义完全一致）：  
     → I’m sort of hungry.（= 我有点饿。）  
   - 正式场景需替换为 “somewhat”“to some extent”（避免用 “kind of”）：  
     → The data is somewhat misleading.（数据有点误导性。—— 商务报告用）

三、高频易错例句（避坑指南）
- 正确：The new policy is kind of confusing.（新政策有点让人困惑。）  
- 错误：The new policy kind of is confusing.（位置错误，“kind of” 需放在系动词后）  
- 正确：We kind of need more time.（我们差不多还需要点时间。）  
- 错误：We need kind of more time.（位置错误，“kind of” 需放在实义动词前）  
- 正确：It’s kind of a long story.（说来话长/算是个挺长的故事。）  
- 错误：It’s a kind of long story.（语序错误，“kind of” 需放在 “a” 前）

“sort of” vs “kind of” 深度辨析（附场景化例句+使用指南）

一、核心共性（90%场景可互换）
两者均为 **口语化副词短语**，核心含义完全一致：「有点、算是、差不多」，仅用于非正式场景（日常沟通、商务非正式对接），正式文件/报告需替换为 `somewhat`「略微」、`to some extent`「在某种程度上」。  

- 语法用法相同：  
  1. 后接形容词/动词：放在系动词后、实义动词前（✅ He is sort of/kind of shy. ✅ She sort of/kind of forgot.）；  
  2. 后接可数名词单数：需加 `a`（✅ It’s sort of/kind of a problem. ❌ It’s sort of/kind of problem.）；  
  3. 均可与 `like` 连用（sort of/kind of like），表「有点像」。

二、关键差异（10%场景需区分）
| 对比维度                | sort of                          | kind of                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **语气强度**            | 更弱、更模糊，带「说不清道不明、难以界定」的感觉（不确定性更强） | 稍强、更明确，带「程度轻微但可感知」的感觉（确定性更高） |
| **地域使用**            | 英美通用，英式口语中更常见        | 美式口语中使用频率远高于英式，美式场景更自然        |
| **搭配偏好**            | 常与「模糊、混合、难以定义」的概念搭配，可与 `like` 连用表「隐约像」 | 常与「明确的感受、特征、程度」搭配，单独使用更自然        |
| **语境适配**            | 适合描述「无法精准描述的状态/事物」 | 适合描述「可精准感知但程度轻微的状态/事物」        |

三、差异场景化例句（直观感受区别）
1. 语气强度：sort of 更模糊，kind of 更明确
- **sort of**（不确定性强，“说不清”）：  
  → I’m sort of tired, but not really.（我算是有点累吧，但又说不上来——不确定是真累还是没精神）  
  → The movie was sort of good, I guess.（这电影算是还行？我也说不好——没有明确的褒贬）  
- **kind of**（程度明确，“能感知”）：  
  → I’m kind of tired after walking 5km.（走了5公里，我有点累——明确感受到累，只是程度不深）  
  → The plan is kind of feasible, but needs adjustments.（这个计划算是可行，只是需要调整——明确判断“可行”，程度轻微）

2. 搭配偏好：sort of 适配「模糊定义」，kind of 适配「明确特征」
- **sort of**（描述“难以界定的事物/状态”）：  
  → It’s sort of a mix of coffee and tea.（这算是咖啡和茶的混合体吧——说不清具体比例，只能模糊描述）  
  → He sort of mumbled a response.（他算是咕哝着回应了——动作不清晰，听不清具体内容）  
  → It’s sort of like a dream.（这有点像一场梦——那种感觉很模糊，难以准确形容）  
- **kind of**（描述“可明确感知的特征”）：  
  → This cake is kind of sweet.（这蛋糕有点甜——能明确尝到甜味，只是甜度不高）  
  → She’s kind of nervous about the interview.（她对面试有点紧张——明确感受到紧张情绪）  
  → The task is kind of difficult.（这个任务有点难——明确判断难度，只是程度轻微）

3. 地域场景适配
- 美式口语（优先用 kind of）：  
  → “Hey, are you busy?” “Kind of—I’m finishing an email.”（“你忙吗？”“有点——我在写邮件收尾。”）  
- 英式口语（两者均可，sort of 稍自然）：  
  → “Do you want to go out?” “Sort of, but I’m not sure.”（“你想出去吗？”“算是吧，但我不确定。”）

四、不可互换的特殊场景（高频考点）
1. **“sort of like” 固定搭配（表「有点像」，优先用 sort of）**  
   描述“隐约相似、难以精准类比”时，`sort of like` 比 `kind of like` 更自然，是口语高频表达：  
   ✅ That new restaurant is sort of like a café, but with more food options.（那家新餐厅有点像咖啡馆，但菜品更多——模糊类比）  
   ❌ That new restaurant is kind of like a café...（语法正确，但语感生硬，美式口语中极少使用）

2. **“kind of” 更适合「委婉否定/弱化态度」**  
   当需要“轻微否定但不直白”时，`kind of` 比 `sort of` 语气更自然，带“虽然……但……”的隐含逻辑：  
   ✅ I kind of don’t agree with his idea.（我算是有点不同意他的想法——委婉否定，不直接反驳）  
   ❌ I sort of don’t agree with his idea.（语法正确，但语气生硬，缺乏委婉感）

五、使用指南（快速判断该用哪个）
| 场景需求                          | 优先选择                          | 例句                                          |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 描述“明确但程度轻微”的感受/特征    | kind of                           | The water is kind of cold.（水有点凉——能明确感知） |
| 描述“模糊、难以界定”的状态/事物    | sort of                           | It’s sort of a mystery.（这算是个谜——说不清楚） |
| 表达“有点像”（模糊类比）          | sort of like                      | He looks sort of like my brother.（他有点像我哥） |
| 美式口语场景（日常/商务非正式）    | kind of                           | We’re kind of behind schedule.（我们有点进度滞后了——美式常用） |
| 英式口语场景                      | sort of                           | She’s sort of busy right now.（她现在算是有点忙——英式更自然） |

六、总结
1. **核心原则**：90%的日常/非正式场景中，`sort of` 和 `kind of` 可完全互换，无需纠结；  
2. **差异重点**：仅当描述“模糊不清的状态”（用 sort of）、“明确轻微的程度”（用 kind of）、“模糊类比”（用 sort of like）时，优先选择对应短语；  
3. **避坑提醒**：两者均为口语化表达，正式场合（合同、报告、学术写作）必须替换为 `somewhat`「略微」、`to some extent`「在某种程度上」、`slightly`「轻微地」等正式表达。

商务场景变体（从口语谈判到正式沟通）

1. **口语谈判版（面谈 / 电话沟通）**
   “This building’s price is way too high. How can we get it down to something we can afford?”
   （翻译：这栋建筑的价格也太高了吧。我们怎么才能把它降到能承受的价位呢？）
