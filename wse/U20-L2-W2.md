Dear Roger:
I know this is going to hurt you a lot, but I've thought about it very carefully, and I'm sure I'm doing the right thing. I want a divorce, Roger.
I've met another man. Perhaps he isn't much of a Casanova(浪荡公子), but he's much kinder to me than you ever were. I don't want to hurt you even more, so I won't tell you who he is.
Life in prison must be very hard. I hope you can see it as a chance to change, Roger. When you come out, you'll be free to start a new life. I hope you find another woman who'll be true to you, like I've been.
I won't come and see you again, Roger, there's no use in it. so this letter is my goodbye to you.
You'll hear from my lawyers in a couple of weeks.
Be strong, and try to understand.
Susan

The food at the restaurant is cooked well.
Let him go where he wants!
That girl's no(才不是、绝对不是、压根不算) friend of mine!
That restaurant serves just over a hundred hamburgers per day.
Quit somking or you'll have a heart attack!
Can't you walk any slower?
Let him visit who he likes.
You really must lose weight!
He's no businessman I know.(他可不是我认识的那种商人/我认识的商人里可没有他这样的)
Can you finish any faster?
