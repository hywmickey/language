I've just been looking at "Manhattan" magazine; they've got a two-page feature.
我刚才一直在翻看《曼哈顿》杂志，里面有一篇两页的专题报道。
现在完成进行时（have been doing）：从过去某时开始，一直持续到刚才结束的动作。
Yeah, the PR agency arranged it.
是的，是公关公司安排的。
You don't get very far in this business without PR.
You don't keep me informed.
你没有及时告知我情况。
I'll explain everything tomorrow, OK?
Thanks for making everything so clear.

Can you meet me at the lawyer's office?
Why, do you want to modify the contract, or something?
I want to buy you out, Mark.
马克，我想收购你的股份（让你退出）。
According to the contract, Ms. Liu can buy you out within six months, at the same price you paid.
Now, if you'd consult me before signing it...
唉，要是你签之前咨询一下我就好了……
Are you amending the contract, or not?
你在修改合同吗，还是没有在改？
amend: 修改（正式文件，强调 “合规性、严肃性”）

I've had an offer, for 20% of the stock.
我收到了一份要约，对方愿意收购 20% 的股份。
I've just sold my stock.
Who to?
Oh, just some investment trust.
一家投资信托公司而已
I did alright, too, I got two and a half million.
我也做得不错，我拿到了250万。/我收益也还不错，拿到了 250 万。

If you want to be successful in business, you can't let anything get in the way.
想在商界取得成功，就不能让任何事情成为阻碍。
Not even friendship.
就连友谊也不行。（或 “即便友谊也不例外。”）
Not even：即便…… 也不
    示例 1（结合商业场景）：“We can't delay the launch for anyone—not even the key investor.”（我们不能为任何人推迟发布，就连核心投资人也不行。）
    示例 2（结合技术场景）：“We can't compromise on code quality for anything—not even a tight deadline.”（我们不能为任何事妥协代码质量，就连紧迫的截止日期也不行。）
It's a tough old world, as they say.
正如人们常说的，这世道本就艰难。
“old”：不指 “年老的”，而是加强语气的虚词，强调 “这种‘艰难’是世界的固有属性，一直如此，并非暂时现象”，中文用 “本就”“向来” 可传递这种语感，避免直译为 “古老的艰难世界”（生硬且误解 “old” 的含义）；
“tough old world” 是英语口语高频搭配，类似中文 “这世道不好混”“日子本就难”，但语气更中性，不偏激。
We've proved that we know how to look after ourselves.
我们已经证明了我们知道如何照顾自己。/我们已经证明了，自己的事能打理好。
I've been doing that all my life, and so have you.
我这辈子一直都这样过来的，你也一样。
I don't care about our business partnership. 
I can let it go like that; it's just another deal.



Could you tell me which agency is handling your advertising?
We have an excellent PR firm doing our advertising.
Can you make this clear to him? It will be so much easier once he understands what we want.
你能跟他把这事说清楚吗？一旦他明白我们的需求，事情就会简单多了。
so much easier:“简单得多”
	so much faster（快得多）、so much better（好得多）
I just read an interesting two-page article on your company. I was really amazed.
我刚读了一篇关于贵公司的有趣的两页文章，真的很赞叹。
I need you to explain to me how this all works. I don't quite understand it.
我需要你跟我解释一下这一切是如何运作的 —— 我不太明白。
This feature in the magazine about the new company looks quite good.
杂志里这篇关于那家新公司的专题报道看起来相当不错。

I would like to make you an offer to buy your company.
Well, it is publicly owned, so you would have to buy stocks in my company.
What percentage would I have to buy in order to own the company?
Well, if you want to buy me out, you would need to buy about 50%.
That is going to be very expensive, but I then again I think of this as an investment.
这事儿会非常贵，但话又说回来，我倒觉得我这股份算是一笔投资。
but then again：话又说回来
After you buy my part of the company, I am going to put all of my money into a trust for my children.
等你收购了我在公司的股份后，我打算把所有钱都投入一个为孩子们设立的信托基金。

Let's work together and form a partnership.
If we want to be successful, we will have to work very hard and make lots of money.
There is nothing more important than friendship because friends can help you out.
If you want to make sure that no one takes anything away from you, you have to look after yourself.
若想确保没人能从你这里夺走任何东西（或 “任何利益”），你就必须自己为自己负责（或 “自己守护好自己”）。
I am determind to successd, so I am not going to let anything get in my way.

翻译：I've just sold my stock to  just some investment trust.

核心翻译  

我刚把我的股份卖给了一家投资信托公司而已。  


解析与拓展（聚焦股权交易场景、口语化语气与术语辨析，适配创业/资产处置情境）  

考虑到你作为程序员可能涉及**创业后股份变现、资产配置**（如出售公司股权给投资机构），这句话的核心是“股份出售对象为投资信托公司”，解析会重点拆解**口语化表达的逻辑**（避免生硬直译）和**金融术语的精准含义**，同时结合股权交易场景补充实用表达。


1. 句式拆解：理清“时态+口语化细节”（翻译关键）  

句子虽短，但两个“just”和时态的使用暗藏语气与逻辑，需逐部分拆解：  
- **前半句：I've just sold my stock**  
  - 时态：**现在完成时（have just sold）**  
    含义：“just”强调“动作刚完成”（卖掉股份的行为发生在“此刻之前不久”），中文用“刚把”精准传递这一时间感，比“我卖掉了”更贴合原句的即时性。  
  - 词汇复用：“my stock”延续你之前接触的**商业场景义“我的股份”**（非“我的库存”），结合上下文（股份出售），无需额外解释，但需注意中文需补充量词“我的股份”（英文不可数名词“stock”在中文中需明确“股份”属性）。  

- **后半句：to just some investment trust**  
  - 两个“just”的逻辑差异：  
    第一个“just”（前半句）表“刚刚”（时间），第二个“just”（后半句）表“只是、不过是”（语气，弱化“投资信托公司”的特殊性，暗示“不是知名大机构，只是普通一家”），中文用“而已”对应这一随意语气，避免直译“只是某家”的生硬感。  
  - 关键术语：**investment trust（投资信托公司）**  
    金融领域专用词，指“通过发行股份募集资金，投资于股票、债券等资产的专业金融机构”（区别于普通“投资公司”，侧重“信托属性”，通常有固定的投资组合和退出机制），中文需完整译为“投资信托公司”，不可简化为“投资公司”（易混淆概念）。  


2. 语用场景：贴合程序员股权变现情境  

这句话的语气是**“随意分享、不刻意强调”**（因“just some”弱化了对象的重要性），常见于以下场景：  
- 和合伙人分享股份出售：“I've just sold my stock to just some investment trust—didn’t want to hold it anymore after the company’s restructuring.”（我刚把我的股份卖给了一家投资信托公司而已——公司重组后，我不想再持有了。）  
- 向朋友说明资产处置：“Remember the stock I had in that tech startup? I've just sold it to just some investment trust for a fair price.”（还记得我在那家科技初创公司的股份吗？我刚以合理价格卖给了一家投资信托公司而已。）  


3. 同义表达替换（适配不同语气/正式度）  

根据沟通对象（合伙人/金融顾问/朋友）调整语气，平衡“随意”与“精准”：  

| 原句（口语化，随意） | 同义表达（语气/正式度调整） | 中文翻译 | 适用场景 |  
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------|----------|  
| to just some investment trust | to a certain investment trust（稍正式） | 卖给了某家投资信托公司 | 向金融顾问、律师沟通时，避免“just some”的随意感，更显专业 |  
| to just some investment trust | to some random investment trust（更口语） | 卖给了一家随便的投资信托公司 | 和朋友闲聊时，强化“不刻意挑选”的随意性 |  
| I've just sold my stock | I've just offloaded my stock（金融口语） | 我刚出手了我的股份 | 与同行、投资人交流时，“offload”是“出售资产”的高频词，比“sell”更贴合股权/股票交易场景 |  


4. 拓展：关键术语辨析与股权交易短语（程序员必备）  

为避免金融术语混淆，同时补充“股份出售”的实用表达，适配你可能的资产处置需求：  
- **术语辨析：investment trust vs. investment company（避免混淆）**  
  | 术语 | 核心差异 | 中文翻译 | 适用场景 |  
  |------|----------|----------|----------|  
  | investment trust | 信托属性，募集资金后委托专业团队投资，投资者持有的是“信托份额” | 投资信托公司 | 股权/股票等中长期投资，侧重“资产托管” |  
  | investment company | 公司属性，直接以公司名义投资，投资者持有的是“公司股份” | 投资公司 | 短期项目投资、股权投资，侧重“直接运营” |  

- **“出售股份”高频短语（覆盖不同场景）**  
  - sell stock to sb.（基础搭配，卖给某人）：“He sold his stock to a venture capital firm.”（他把股份卖给了一家风投公司。）  
  - offload stock（口语/金融，“出手股份”，含“不想再持有”的隐含义）：“Many early employees offloaded their stock after the IPO.”（IPO后，很多早期员工都出手了股份。）  
  - dispose of stock（正式/法律，“处置股份”，用于合同、财报）：“The shareholder disposed of 10% of his stock in the company.”（该股东处置了其在公司10%的股份。）  


5. 语法延伸：“just”的多场景用法（避免误解）  

原句中两个“just”是口语化难点，总结其在商业/日常场景的核心含义，帮助你后续准确理解：  
| “just”的含义 | 场景示例（股权/日常） | 中文翻译 |  
|--------------|------------------------|----------|  
| 刚刚（时间） | I've just received the offer. | 我刚收到要约。 |  
| 只是/不过（语气） | It’s just a small investment. | 只是一笔小额投资而已。 |  
| 正好（数量/程度） | The offer is just what I expected. | 这个要约正好符合我的预期。 |  

通过以上拆解，既能精准翻译原句，也能避免后续遇到“just”时因含义混淆导致的理解偏差。
