MONGOLIA

Imagine a country that goes back over 2,000 years, a land where time seems to have stood still, but which is so beautiful and vast that it boggles the mind. It is a country which still favors horses to cars and a country where nomnads still exist as they did thousands of years ago. It is a land without fences, gates, or barricades. It is a country where the enormity of the flowing steppes and their palette of shades of green extends as far as the eye can see. Ninety percent of the country is desert and pastures. It has a population of almost 3 million, and about half of those people live in the capital city or in other urbanlocations. This is Mongolia, a land where the countryside and endless skies look like a painting of an untouched landscape of long ago. With pure air and water, the visitor will seem to have stepped back in time, to an age when nature was left unspoiled. Mongolia is a land with a history that is as romantic and interesting as its landscape is beautiful.

Mongolia is located between China and Russia and is about the size of Alaska. It was made famous by Genghis Khan, the most well-known Mongolian in history, who by 1280 A.D. has conquered every village from Moscow to Arabia and to Hong Kong. When his empire collapsed, the invaders became the invaded. The Manchurians came first, and when they left, the Russians came. The Soviet influence is still evident in Mongolia today. Russian style architecture is seen in many of the buildings in the capital city of Ulban Bator.

Tourism

Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator holds many remnants of its Soviet past. The Russian Cyrillic alphabet, imposed upon the Mongolians in the 1940s, can still be seen in signs, and many of the buildings are plain Soviet structures. However, the capital does offer some impressive attractions. There is the National History Museum where the tourist can find dinosaur bones and eggs on exhibit. After that, there is the Zanabazar Fine Arts Museum which boasts Buddhist scupltures. There is also the Winter Palace of Bogd Khann. Finally, there is the Ganden Monastery.

After the sights, have a feast of mutton, the one dish that you can find everywhere, and mare's milk. After satisfying one's hunger, there is shopping. Mongolian souvenirs might include cashmere sweaters, camel hair blankets, fur, felt rugs, and oil and water color paintings being sold for a bargain by the many art students.

Once you leave Ulan Bator the vastness of Mongolia, the never-ending landscape, engulfs you. Mongolia stretches for miles, across the constant sea of rolling green landscape. If you are lucky you will see the jackals and deer in the countryside. One impressive destination surrounded by the Mongolian mountains is Terkhiin Tsagaan Nuur, or Great White Lake, a vast expanse of fresh water overflowing with fish seemingly in the middle of nowhere.

While on these types of expeditions into the nature of Mongolia, you may notice groups of round white sturctures. These are the ger camps where tourists can experience a typical Mongolian dwelling. A ger is the traditional Mongolian home, a type of felt-covered tent which takes four people about 30 minutes to assemble. The door of a ger always face south by tradition. The gers are extrenely comfortable. As typical Mongolian homes, they are made to house a family and their animals in even the harshest conditions possible. With a fire in the center of the tent, the ger becomes comfortably warm, perfect for a good night's sleep. The camps are immaculate, and the settings could not be more amazing, The food is very good, and the people are friendly.

Staying in a camp of gers is the perfect way to get into the spirit of Mongolian tradition before taking part in the Naadam festival which takes place all over the country. This festival is comprised of competitions in archery, wrestling, and horse racing, based on traditional skills required of the ancient Mongolian warriors. For three days, spectators can watch displays of archery and wrestling, but the biggest draw for many is the horse racing. The Mongolian people have long been skilled riders, and the Naadam festival is a chance to see some of the finest horses and riders, some as young as 6 years old. Riders race routes of ten to thirty miles, depending on the age of the horse, driving their fine horses in search of victory. This festival is Mongolia at its finest with tradition meeting nature.
