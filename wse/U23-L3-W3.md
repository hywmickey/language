We're here at a children's doctor's office, also known as a  pediatrician's(儿科医生的) office,
to talk to parents and doctors about rasing healthy kids.

Generally pediatrics(小儿科) in the United States encompasses(包括，涉及) taking care of their physical needs,
taking care of their only_sis__.

and vaccinating them to make sure that they're immune against disease.
We have eight practitioners(专业人员), and about eight thousand patients.
Most countries don't have private practices like we have in the United States.
That's one of the reasons we have such an expensive healthcare system. 
I don't know if it's right way to go, but it does offer the advantage(优势) of letting me have contact with patients and their families.
Our system is unique in the world, I think.

I think we're really lucky to have the healthcare system that we have.
Both of my children, myself and my husband have health insurance through my husband's work.
It's terrific, because I don't think twice about taking my kids to the doctors.

Here's always time to bring your children in, if they are sick.
If they have tummy ache(肚子疼), a headache...

We're here at the doctors' office today, because Lizzy woke up with a stomach ache this morning. 
and a fever of 100.3.
So we want to make sure she gets better soon.

The pediatricians here are terrific at answering questions about growth patterns(生长发育规律), __ here __ issues
be terrific at: 擅长……
what's propry__ for their age, and questions like that.

And we take care of people from birth unitl they get tired of coming here.

Use the common knowledge that you learn from other people and from your own parents.

Are there some recurring(反复出现) issues that parents come in and ask you about?
The common issues that you'd expect they would ask: their safety, their health, their discipline, and what to do abut it.
discipline（管教）：如孩子行为习惯培养、犯错时如何引导等
Well, obviously, rasing children is just a big responsibility.
You worry, and you have high hopes for your children.
I think parenting(育儿) is a really, really hard job:
much more challenging and harder than I would ever have thought.
But it's also more rewarding that I would have thought.



She's sick. She should go to the doctor.
She is taking her child to the pediatrician for some tests.
The doctors' offices have eight practioners.
The doctor's offices serve about eight thousand patients.
Most countries don't have private practices where doctors work.
If I'm sick, I go to the clinic. If it's a more serious problem, I go to the hospital.

medical: disease, fever, ache, sick
healthcare: medication, painkiller, vaccine
person: pediatrician ,patient, practitioner

She asked to see a doctor.
Ke kept mentioning that he had a headache.
They decided to put her in the hospital.
He was neverous about getting the vaccine.
They expect to receive the insurance money soon.
His doctor advised him to eat more vegetables.

We're here to talk to parents and doctors about raising healthy kids.
Generally, pediatrics in the United States encompasses taking care of children's physical needs.
It's important to vaccinate children to make soure that they're immune against disease.
We take care of people from birth until they get tired of coming here.
The patients don't leave the clinic until the doctors are sure everything had been taken care of.
If you use common sense, you're going to solve most problems without needing to see a doctor.

Most countries don't have private practices like we have in the United States.
That's one of the reasons we have such an expensive healthcare system.
I don't know if our system is the right way to go.
but it does offer the advantage of letting we have contact with patients and their family.
For example, a married couple with two children can have health insurance through one parent's work.
That's great, because the parents don't have to think twice about taking their kids to the doctor.

Tell me the challenges you face with raising your kids.
Well, obviously, raising children is wonderful.
You worry, and you have high hopes for your children.
I think parenting is a really, really hard job.
Taking care of children is a big responsibility.
But it's also more rewarding than I would have thought, and that's very nice.
Are there some recurring issues that parents come in and ask you about?
Parents want to discuss their children's safety, their health, their discipline, and what to do about it.

KEEPING YOUR KIDS HEALTHY
From the flu to broken bones, illnesses and medical emergencies are part of raising kids, It can be stressfull any time you child needs medical attention, but even more so when you're worried about where to get that care and how mouch it will cost.
About Consumer - Directed Health Care
We have more options for getting health care and paying for it than ever before. There is a movement toward consumer-directed health care, health insurance that tries to get those who use health care - like parents - to play a bigger part in keeping costs lower.
Many different types of consumer - directed health care plans are available, each with its own benefits and limitations. Many of there plans feature high deductibles(the amout of money parents must spend before health care is overed by insurance) as well as health care savings accounts, which allow parents to save money to pay for the services that insurance doesn't cover. Some plans cover preventive care, routine checkups, vaccines and regular tests, but others don't. So when you're choosing health insurance, it's important to look for a plan that meet your family's needs.
Rising costs and increased variety among health care plans can make it difficult to find you way in the health care system. The good news is that making decisions while everyone is healthy can help reduce the stress and costs when someone in your family does need medical care.
Choose your coverage carefully. Carefully consider your family's health care needs. While it's impossible to predict sudden illnesses and accidents, you can predict some things. For example, if your child already had a disease that requires frequent checkups and tests, make sure to pick a plan that covers them. The insurer - or your employer - should be able to answer any questions about those kinds of issues.
Make a medical home. Try to establish a long-term relationship with a pediatrician or family doctor who can:
get to know your family
provide well-care and most of the sick-care your child might need
keep complete medical records of things like immunizations and growth
become familiar with your family's medical histroy
A doctor who has all this information, and gets to know your family over time, can better detemine when your child is healthy and developing well and when someting if off track.
Don't skip checkups. It's important to keep regular checkups even kids aren't sick - this way, doctors can make sure they're developing as expected and can catch any health concerns early so that they don't become expensive and hard-to-treat medical problems later. Not having reqular check-ups may save time and money in the short-term, but might trun into bigger bills and longer waits at the doctor's office later. If parents wait until kids are really sick to see the doctor, they're likely to require more intensive-and expensive-meical care. And if hospitals and doctors have to provide a large amount of more expensive care, they'll have to charge consumers more to cover their costs.
Keep vaccines up-to-date. Checkups are especially important so that kids can stay current on their immunizations. In recent years, vaccines have been developed to stem illnesses like the flu, infantile diarrhea(rotavirus), hepatitis, memingitis, and human papillomavirus(HPV), Parents have more opportunities than ever to keep kids healthy and safe from contagious illnesses.
Don't delay care. When kids are sick or injured, it can be difficult to decide how much medical care they need. Ultimatelly, if you're unsure about what medical care your child needs, your doctor-or a nurse who works in the office-can help you determine what to do. The important thing is to ask questions before something turns into an emergency.
Check it out before you act on it. More health and medical information is available than ever before-on the Internet, through support groups, in magazines and newspapers. All that information can be helpful, but it should never substitute from medical care or advice given directly to you by a medical professional. It's important to check out anything you hear or read that might apply to your child's health with a doctor or nurse before you act on it. He or she can tell you whether that information is accurate and appropriate, based on your child's health and medical history.

It can be stressful any time your child needs medical attention.
