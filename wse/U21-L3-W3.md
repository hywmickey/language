WELLCOME TO HARRY'S SHOPPER'S PARADISE(天堂)!

At Harry's, of course!
WHO SHOPS AT HARRY'S?
The top celebrities in New York are good customers, but we have millions of other customers, and our friendly assistants treat each one of them like royalty(皇室). And that's not easy, when we have to look after 50,000 customers every day of the year and as many as 300,000 customers on the first day of the bargain(特价，廉价) sales!
IS HARRY'S EXPENSIVE?
Well, that depends on how much you want to spend. The most money ever spent by just one customer in a signle visit to Harry's was three million two hundred thousand dollars, and he paid the bill in cash. Not all our shoppers have that much money to spend, though. A lot of the things we sell are very good value and, of course, the best quality.
WHERE CAN YOU GET SOMETHING FOR THE MAN/WOMAN WHO HAS EVERYTHING?
In our special gift department that's where! At Christmas time we have a special gift department where all the presents cost more than one thousand dollars. But if you can't afford something really special, you can be sure to find a wonderful gift in our other department. Why not buy your loved one a Christmas fruitcake? They are one of the most popular buys at Christmas time - we sell over 120 tons of Christmas fruitcakes every year.
YOU DON'T LIVE IN THE USA, BUT YOU WANT TO SHOP AT HARRY'S?
No problem - many of our customers are overseas visitors, and we have a very fash and efficient export service. We will transport anything from our store to any city in the world. Nothing is too big or too small for our attention(关注，注意力). Last year we flew half a kilo of Harry's best sausages to a boat in the Mediterranean, and six bread rolls to a customer in Hollywood. We also exported a Persian carpet(波斯地毯) to Iran and a fridge to Finland!
