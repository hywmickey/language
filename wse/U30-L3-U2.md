DIVORCE AND CHILDREN

The most important factor in divorce for any parents should be the effect of the divorce on their children. It is therefore important for couples to understand what the children are feeling and thinking, and to know what they can do to help their children cope with the divorce.

What does a child feel when her parents are getting divorced?

Children often exhibit one or more of the following:
Feeling that they are the cause of conflict between the parents
Feeling responsible for getting the parents back together
Physical and/or mental illness
Development of self-esteem problems, which can show itself in the form of aggressive behaviour (specially towards other children, eg. bullying of other children) or being withdrawn
Feeling a sense of loss (research has shown that children faced with divorce show the same symptoms as ones who are faced with the death of a parent)
Never forgetting their personal pain during the parents divorce (which means, in almost every case, it will impact on their own future relationships)

Helping children cope with divorce
Do not wait until the actual divorce date before you tell your children you are getting divorced. Children usually know when something is seriously wrong between their parents is a slow torture for them. Children tend to have an active immagination. When faced with the divorce of their parents, this can go into overdrive, which can result in the children creating terrifying scenarios about the futrue in their mind. Once you have decided on divorce, it is therefore important that you tell your children as soon as possible and explain to them exactly what is going to happen to them.
When telling the children that you are no longer going to live together, make sure you tell them together. This makes them feel a sense of security as they know that it's what both parents want.
Make sure that you don't put the blame for the divorce on any one parent.
Make sure that things are kepty very simple so the child can easily understand.
Make it clean for your children that the divorce is NOT their fault.
Reassure the children that you are both going to still love them and that how you feel towards them has not, and is not going to change.
Acknowledge that this whole situation is difficult and sad for everyone.

What the parents must NOT do
The distress the children feel is a common side-effect of any divorce. This emotional instability will become a matter of serious concern however, when:
The parents have long and messy custody battles
One parent triesto involve the child in the middle of an argument
One parent openly blames the other for the divorce
Parents try and make the child choose sides

```
# test
Children might feel that the problem in their parent's marriage and the job of solving those problems, are down to them.
孩子们可能会觉得，父母婚姻中的问题以及解决这些问题的责任，都落在了他们身上。
are down to them：核心短语，表示 “是某人的责任、由某人承担、落在某人身上”，强调 “责任或义务被强加于某人”，译为 “都落在了他们身上” 既生动又准确，也可灵活译为 “都该由他们负责”（稍直白）。

As a result of a divorce, a child may behave badly towards other children.
A children may also become quieter and less interactive with others than previously.
Divorce can make a child feel the same as if one of her parents has died.
A divorce will have long-term effects on a child's emothional life.
Not telling a child well in advance about a divorce can result in her feeling extremely anxious and uncertain about her future.
不提前充分告知孩子父母要离婚，可能会导致她对未来感到极度焦虑和迷茫。
well in advance：核心短语，表 “提前充分、早早地”（比 in advance 语气更强，强调 “预留足够时间让孩子适应”），译为 “提前充分”，既准确又简洁；
can result in：译为 “可能会导致”，比直译 “能导致” 更委婉，贴合 “推测性后果” 的语境（并非绝对必然，而是潜在风险），同义替换：may lead to（更口语）、might cause（更正式）。
feeling extremely anxious and uncertain：译为 “感到极度焦虑和迷茫”。
    anxious/uncertain 高频搭配：
    anxious about sth.（为某事焦虑）→ He’s anxious about his exam results.（译：他为考试成绩焦虑。）
    uncertain of/about sth.（对某事迷茫 / 不确定）→ She’s uncertain about her career path.（译：她对自己的职业道路感到迷茫。）

It's not advisable for one parent on their own to tell their children about the divorce, it's better done together.
Divorcing couples should not tell the child that any one partner is responsible for the divorce.
It's important to let a child know that they have no responsibility for the divorce.
Divorce can be even more difficult for a child if one of the parents tries to get the child to take her/his side.

    解析：“淘到”“竟然”贴合日常表达，突出“偶然发现带来重大影响”的意外感。

用法总结

- **核心功能**：作为评注性状语，表达“结果/效果与预期不符”的意外感，可放在句首（最常用）或句中（如：The plan, in a surprising way, succeeded）。  
- **翻译技巧**：避免直译“以令人惊讶的方式”，优先用“说来意外”“令人没想到的是”“有些意外”等符合中文口语节奏的表达，根据语境调整惊讶程度。  
- **搭配逻辑**：后接“看似……实则……”“本以为……却……”的转折关系，常与 `actually`/`rather than`/`turn out to` 等词呼应，强化意外效果。

是否需要针对某类场景（如职场、情感）补充更多例句，或整理“意外类评注性状语”（如 `Surprisingly`/`Unexpectedly`）的替换用法？

“because then” 核心用法：衔接 **前因后果**，“then” 指代“（因为前面的行为/情况）所以接下来会发生某事”，强调“前因导致的直接、自然的后果”，比单纯用 “because” 更突出“因果的连贯性”，口语和书面语都常用。

以下按 **不同场景** 举例，附中文翻译和用法解析，方便你直接套用：

一、日常建议场景（最常用）

1. **英文**：You should drink more water every day, because then you’ll stay hydrated and avoid headaches.  
   **中文**：你每天应该多喝点水，因为那样一来你就能保持水分充足，避免头痛。

   解析：前因“撒谎”→ 后果“失去信任+难以修复”，强调“负面行为的连锁反应”。

四、用法总结（帮你快速掌握）

1. 结构：**建议/行为/决定 + because then + 直接后果**（后果通常是“会发生什么”，用 will/won’t/can/can’t 等情态动词）。  
2. 语气：比 “because” 更口语化、更自然，适合日常交流、建议、提醒等场景。  
3. 替换：可以和 “because in that case”（更正式）、“otherwise”（反之，表负面后果）替换，比如：  
   - You need to plan ahead, because in that case you won’t miss the deadline.（更正式）  
   - Don’t procrastinate, otherwise you’ll be stressed.（反之，负面后果）

`The most painful, and probably the most common one is when one partner has an affair.`

为什么要用when，而不是that, which, what?

要搞懂为什么用 **when** 而非 **that/which/what**，核心是先明确原句的语法结构，再对比四个引导词的**功能边界**和**语境适配性**——原句的关键是“表语从句要表达‘某一种具体场景/情况’”，而只有 **when** 能精准匹配这个需求。


第一步：先拆原句的核心结构

原句完整结构：  
**The most painful, and probably the most common one（主语） is（系动词） when one partner has an affair（表语从句）.**  
（最痛苦也最常见的情况，是“其中一方有外遇”这件事。）

这里的关键：`is` 后面是 **表语从句**（用一个句子充当表语，解释主语“the most common one”具体是什么）。我们需要选择的引导词，必须能让这个表语从句**语义完整、逻辑通顺**。


第二步：逐一分析“为什么不用that/which/what”

1. 为什么不用 **that**？（语法可通，但语义/语境不贴合）
- `that` 引导表语从句的核心特点：  
  只起“连接作用”，**不充当从句成分**，也**不自带语义**（相当于“空引导词”），从句本身必须是“完整的陈述句”（主谓宾/主系表齐全）。  
- 若强行用 `that`：  
  ✅ 语法成立：`The most common one is that one partner has an affair.`（译为“最常见的情况是其中一方有外遇。”）  
- 但为什么原句不用？  
  语义缺少“场景感”：原句讨论的是“婚姻危机的诱因”，强调的是“某一个具体发生的场景/情况”，而 `that` 只单纯“陈述一个事实”，没有“指向某一特定情境”的含义，不如 `when` 贴合“婚姻中突发危机”的语境（`when` 隐含“在这种情况下”的场景感）。  
- 简单说：`that` 是“平铺直叙说事实”，`when` 是“聚焦某个具体场景”，原句需要后者。

2. 为什么不用 **which**？（语义和功能完全不匹配）
- `which` 引导从句的核心特点：  
  ① 表“哪一个”（有明确的“选择范围”）；② 引导定语从句时，需在从句中充当主语/宾语（指代前文的名词）。  
- 不适配原句的原因：  
  ① 原句表语从句没有“选择范围”（不是“在A、B、C中选一个”），`which` 的“选择含义”无依托；  
  ② 若想让 `which` 引导定语从句，需指代前文的“the most common one”，但原句是表语从句（`is` 后面直接接从句，不是修饰前面的名词），结构上不成立；  
- 错误示例：`The most common one is which one partner has an affair.`（语法混乱，语义不通）。

3. 为什么不用 **what**？（语法结构不允许）
- `what` 引导表语从句的核心特点：  
  必须在从句中**充当主语、宾语或表语**（即从句本身“缺少核心成分”时才用 `what`），且 `what` 自带语义（相当于“the thing that/which”，“……的事情/东西”）。  
- 不适配原句的原因：  
  原句的表语从句 `one partner has an affair` 是**完整的句子**（主语：one partner；谓语：has；宾语：an affair），不缺任何成分！  
  若强行用 `what`，`what` 会“多余”（没有成分可充当），语法错误。  
- 错误示例：`The most common one is what one partner has an affair.`（从句成分完整，`what` 无作用，语法不通）。


第三步：为什么偏偏用 **when**？（精准匹配语境+语法）

- `when` 引导表语从句的核心功能：  
  表示“**某一个特定的场景、时刻或情况**”，相当于 “the situation in which”（“在……的情况下”），自带“场景感”，且不要求从句缺成分（从句可完整）。  
- 原句中 `when` 的作用：  
  把“one partner has an affair”这个事实，转化为“导致婚姻危机的那个具体场景”，完美呼应主语“the most painful, and probably the most common one”（最痛苦也最常见的“情况”）。  
- 同义替换验证（更直观）：  
  原句可改写为：`The most common one is the situation when one partner has an affair.`  
  （这里 `when` 引导定语从句修饰 `the situation`，本质语义和原句一致，说明 `when` 核心是“指向某个场景”）。


总结：四个引导词的核心区别（表格更清晰）

| 引导词 | 核心功能                          | 从句是否缺成分 | 原句中不适用的原因                          |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| when   | 引导表语从句，表“某场景/时刻”     | 可不缺         | ✅ 适配“婚姻危机的具体诱因”场景，语义贴合    |
| that   | 引导表语从句，仅起连接作用（无义）| 不缺           | ❌ 无“场景感”，仅陈述事实，语境匹配度低      |
| which  | 表“哪一个”（有选择范围）；引导定语从句 | 缺（需充当成分）| ❌ 无选择范围，且原句是表语从句（非定语从句）|
| what   | 引导表语从句，需充当从句成分（主/宾/表） | 缺             | ❌ 从句成分完整，`what` 无成分可充当，语法错 |

一句话记住：

表语从句若想表达“**某一个具体场景/情况/时刻**”，且从句结构完整，就用 `when`；  
从句缺成分用 `what`；  
无场景感、单纯陈述事实可用 `that`（但语境要匹配）；  
有选择范围才用 `which`。
