And all you ever do is talk___ them.
You're supposed to be a police officer, not a social worker!
你应当是警察，而非社会工作者。
So it's all my fault, is it?
How was I supposed to know that Petri wasn't on that plane?
I suppose I'd better go out and do some shopping.
I'll have a look at myself.
My God! I look awful.
I suppose I'll have to wash my face, and put on some makeup.
I don't feel like it! I don't feel like anything!
Do you still find me attractive?
Or are you starting to find me horrible and ugly?
I hate myself!
I'll just take a couple of pills and go to sleep.
I just want to forget about everything!

I've got to go back to Trinidad!
get to ： 必须，与have to 同义
It's down to me to sort it out again!
又得靠我来解决这事了！
sort out: 整理；解决（问题）
I've got to sort this out now or I could lose my job.

I'll have to pack a suitcase and run.
I'll take this light cotton suit, and these ties, and this shirt, and this one, and a pair of black shoes, and a few pairs of socks.
cotton suit: 棉质西装，
I'll just get my washing and shaving things, razor, soap, towel.
You don't mind if I take the shampoo, do you?
toothpaste... toothbrush...

Look love, this really isn't the right moment.
There's nothing to talk about.
So would you like me to go on as if I didn't care?
那你是想让我装作毫不在意，继续这样下去吗？
As if it didn't matter to me whether you're here or not?
I'm going to miss that plane if I don't leave right now.

I'll have to go to the pharmacy and get some more.
Yes, I'd like 50 more of these.
I'm sorry, you can only get them by prescription.
You'll have to go to your doctor for another one.


How was I supposed to know that Petri wasn't on that plane?
我怎么会知道Petri不在那架飞机上呢？
You were supposed to catch Petri, Peters, not chat with him.
I was supposed to be there at 8 o'clock. I'm going to be late!
I suppose you want to know what happend.
I suppose I should go home. It's late.
Susan, you were supposed to go to the doctor's today. Did you forget?
Yes, he's supposed to be in prison, but he's escaped.

OK, so I'll need to shave when I'm there. Where's my razor?
I think I'll take some soap. I don't like washing my face with that cheap stuff they give you in hotels.
You don't mind if I take the shampoo, do you? I'll need to wash my hair.
Do you know where the tie that goes with my suit is?
“go with” : “与…… 相配、搭配”
I can't forget to bring my toothbrush and, of course, the toothpaste.
It's so hot in the Caribbean. I'd better take my cotton suit off.
OK, I have all my clothes ready. Now, I can pack my suitcase.

So it's all my fault, is it?
I'll show you. You'll see what a good police officer I am!
They won't get away from me this time. No way!
I wasn't expecting what bloody Thacker said to me either!
我也没料到那个该死的萨克会对我说那种话！
So, it's down to me to solve thie problem again.
I've got to sort this out now or I could lose my job.
Look, I'm not going there on vacation, damn it!
How was I supposed to know that I couldn't go in that place?

I can't just go on as if I didn't care, when I love you so much!
You know how much I hate you gong away. You can't expect me to act as if didn't matter.
He behaves as if he as in his twenties, but he's almost forty.
Why is she all dressed up as if she was going for tea with the Queen?
all dressed up：精心打扮、盛装打扮, 打扮得比平时正式或夸张
Harry doesn't like talking about problems, he just goes on as if everything was fine between him and Susan.
It's July already, but it's as cold as if it was still winter.
Don't talk to me as if I was a child, I'm nearly twenty!
The team aren't playing well, it's as if they didn't care whether they win or not.

My hair! My face! My God! I look awful!
I should wash my face, but I don't feel like it.
Just drinking, that's the only thing I'm good for!
Do you still think I'm attractive, or do you fine me horrible and ugly?
Just a friend? So that's all I mean to him!
Why do I feel so bad? What's the matter with me?
I just want to forget about everything!

Look at yourself! You're so dirty!
I think Hilda's a little strange, because she always talks to herself.
I want to kill myself! I did something really stupid!
Susan is telling herself that Harry has another woman.
He thinks he's so cute. He should look at himself in the mirror!
Why do you hate yourself so much?
Oliver and Harold gave themselves a big party for their 40th birthday.
We should ask ourselves why we worry so much about what we look like.
There's coffee in the kitchen. You and Andrea can serve yourselves.

I think I will take for pairs.
It never gets cold in Trinidad.
Just two pairs, I think, after all, I only be there for two days.

Let's say goodbye now, because I won't see you again before I leave.
Oh God! Look at me! I look awful! Too much to drink again last night...
There are my glasses! What the hell were they doing there?
Ricently, the area has attaracted a lot of tourists.
Last month, we flew from London to New York with British Airways.
They spent thousands of dollars on their daughter's wedding last year.
I am going to miss my train if I don't leave right now.
Are you coming to my party tonight?
You never listen to me, do you?
All you ever do these days is talk, talk, talk.
I don't think he should go to the gym today. He's sick.
I just got a call from my friend Luis. I haven't talked to him since December!
