In America when married couples have problems, they sometimes go to a marriage counselor to work through those problems.

You can't separate your emotions too much, because then you're not really feeling what people are going through.
你不能过度压抑自己的情绪，因为那样一来，你就无法真正体会到别人正在经历的感受。
separate your emotions: 不是字面意义的 “分离情绪”，而是口语中表示 “刻意割裂、压抑自身情绪” 的表达。
because then：译为 “因为那样一来”，比单纯译 “因为那时” 更自然，衔接因果逻辑，体现 “过度压抑情绪” 与 “无法共情” 的直接关联。
go through: 此处表示 “经历（困境、处境等）”，译为 “正在经历的感受” 既保留 “经历” 的动作感，又突出 “情绪共鸣” 的核心。
同义替换: You shouldn’t suppress your emotions excessively, otherwise you won’t be able to truly empathize with what others are going through.（译：你不该过度压抑情绪，否则无法真正共情他人的遭遇。）

Right now in this country 50 percent of marriages survive and 50 percent of them don't.

The most painful one is the discovery of an affair.
其中最令人痛苦的，是发现伴侣有外遇。
完整语境示例：When couples seek marriage counseling, there’s usually a specific trigger. Usually, it’s something that has caused some kind of crisis or upset. Among these, the most painful is the discovery of an affair.（译：当夫妻寻求婚姻咨询时，通常有一个具体的导火索。往往是某件引发了某种危机或困扰的事，其中最痛苦的就是发现伴侣有外遇。）

People are so busy being mothers and fathers that they don't spend as much time thinking about being husband and wife.
人们太过忙于为人父母，以至于没有太多时间去思考如何为人夫妻。
being husband and wife：译为 “为人夫妻”，与前文 “为人父母” 结构对称，突出 “夫妻角色” 的责任与相处之道，而非单纯 “成为夫妻”（毕竟他们已是夫妻，核心是 “如何做好夫妻”）。
同义替换（丰富表达）：People are so caught up in their roles as parents that they barely have time to focus on their relationship as husband and wife.（译：人们太过沉浸于父母的角色，几乎没有时间关注彼此作为夫妻的关系。）
词汇延伸：
    be caught up in（短语）：沉浸于、忙于（比 be busy 更强调 “被事务占据而无法抽身”）
    focus on their relationship：关注彼此的关系（比 think about being husband and wife 更直白，突出 “夫妻关系” 本身）
    barely have time：几乎没有时间（比 don't spend as much time 语气更强，突出 “时间匮乏”）

So often couples are having real trouble because they can't say something simple, like "I miss you".
Instead what they're saying is "I'm mad at you because you're never around."
And sometimes it drives people craszy.

        marital relationship（正式短语）：婚姻关系（适用于报告、文章等书面场景）
        fade into the background（短语）：渐渐淡出、不再受关注
 
It's not easy for anyone to come to couple therapy, to have to admit that they're dealing with issues that feel bigger than they are.
In a relationship, it helps to say something like "I miss you" instead of "I'm mad at you".
Sometimes it drives people crazy that they don't know their partner as well as they think they do.

用because then举例

“because then” 核心用法：衔接 **前因后果**，“then” 指代“（因为前面的行为/情况）所以接下来会发生某事”，强调“前因导致的直接、自然的后果”，比单纯用 “because” 更突出“因果的连贯性”，口语和书面语都常用。

以下按 **不同场景** 举例，附中文翻译和用法解析，方便你直接套用：

一、日常建议场景（最常用）

1. **英文**：You should drink more water every day, because then you’ll stay hydrated and avoid headaches.  
   **中文**：你每天应该多喝点水，因为那样一来你就能保持水分充足，避免头痛。  
   解析：前因“多喝水”→ 后果“补水、不头痛”，“because then” 衔接“建议行为”和“积极结果”。

2. **英文**：Don’t leave your phone charging overnight, because then it might overheat or damage the battery.  
   **中文**：别让手机整夜充电，因为那样的话它可能会过热，或者损坏电池。  
   解析：前因“整夜充电”→ 后果“过热、伤电池”，用于“提醒负面行为的风险”。

3. **英文**：Try to wake up 10 minutes earlier, because then you won’t have to rush to work.  
   **中文**：试着早起10分钟，因为那样你就不用匆忙赶上班了。  
   解析：前因“早起”→ 后果“不匆忙”，贴合日常作息建议，语气自然。

二、学习/工作场景

4. **英文**：Make sure to take notes during the meeting, because then you can review the key points later.  
   **中文**：开会时一定要记笔记，因为那样之后你就能复习重点了。  
   解析：前因“记笔记”→ 后果“方便后续复习”，适用于职场/学习中的“实用行为”。

5. **英文**：Don’t cram for exams at the last minute, because then you’ll forget most of what you’ve studied.  
   **中文**：别在最后一刻临时抱佛脚备考，因为那样你会忘记大部分学过的内容。  
   解析：前因“临时抱佛脚”→ 后果“遗忘知识点”，针对学习习惯的提醒。

6. **英文**：Finish the report today, because then we can discuss it with the client tomorrow.  
   **中文**：今天把报告做完，因为那样我们明天就能和客户讨论了。  
   解析：前因“今天完成报告”→ 后果“明天可推进下一步工作”，突出“工作流程的连贯性”。

三、情感/人际关系场景（呼应你之前的句子）

7. **英文**：You should listen to your friend’s problems carefully, because then they’ll feel valued and supported.  
   **中文**：你要认真听朋友的烦恼，因为那样他们会觉得被重视、被支持。  
   解析：前因“认真倾听”→ 后果“朋友感受到重视”，和你之前学习的“共情”主题呼应。

8. **英文**：Don’t lie to your family, because then you’ll lose their trust and it will be hard to fix.  
   **中文**：别对家人撒谎，因为那样你会失去他们的信任，而且很难挽回。  
   解析：前因“撒谎”→ 后果“失去信任+难以修复”，强调“负面行为的连锁反应”。

四、用法总结（帮你快速掌握）

1. 结构：**建议/行为/决定 + because then + 直接后果**（后果通常是“会发生什么”，用 will/won’t/can/can’t 等情态动词）。  
2. 语气：比 “because” 更口语化、更自然，适合日常交流、建议、提醒等场景。  
3. 替换：可以和 “because in that case”（更正式）、“otherwise”（反之，表负面后果）替换，比如：  
   - You need to plan ahead, because in that case you won’t miss the deadline.（更正式）  
   - Don’t procrastinate, otherwise you’ll be stressed.（反之，负面后果）

这些例子都贴近生活和学习，你可以根据自己的场景调整主语和谓语，比如把 “you” 换成 “we/they”，把 “drink water” 换成你熟悉的动作，很快就能上手～
