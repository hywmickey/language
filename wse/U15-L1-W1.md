You said you loved me!
You don't love me, Roger!
You don't know what that word means!
I love your hair, and your eyes.
Why don't you go back to Susan?
She's much better than me!
What are you talking about?

I need to speak to you, Kristi! Let me in.
You know how much I need you.
I said go away!
Stay away from me!
Get this man out of my room, will you?
Get out of my way!(让开)

Why do I always go out with bastards like him?
Why can't I find a man who respects me?

You heared what I said.
I saw you, Roger.
You were with Kristi.
I just had a business lunch with her, that's all.
She wanted to talk about business idea.
Let me tell you what happened?
Kirsti and I went out together, but it's over now.
And that's the truth. Please belive me.
You can call Kristi and ask her. If you don't belive me.
How can I possibly call Kristi?
Why don't we have a vacation and start over?
I want a divorce, Roger, and I never want to see you again.
You only married me, because my father's the CEO of the airline.
You just married me to get a job.
I'll call the police!
Go on then, call them!
OK Susan, calm down. Please belive me.
You don't love me and you never loved me.
That's not true.

I loved him before, but I don't anymore.
I had an appointment at 10:00.
He just married his wife to get a visa.
I don't know what happened.
Kayo went out with Yuji last year.
Christophe wanted to start a new company.
I saw my wife with another man.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was with a client.
I heard a great band last night.

I love him. I want to see him again.
I love your eyes. They're beautiful.
I never want to see you again.
It's over now, I want a divorce.
Max and I aren't together now. He went back to his girlfried.
I married him because I love him.
I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore.
We went out together.

Why do I always go out with bastards like him?
You don't love me. You don't know what the word means.
You can call her if you don't believe me.
I need a woman who respects me.

I don't love you. Please go away!
Kristi, please come back!
I must see Kristi. Call her immediately!
I need to see you. Please let me in!
Help! Get this man out of my room!
Get out of my way!
I'm not with Kristi anymore. Please belive me!
Get out, Roger! Or I'll call the police!

You know how much I need a job.
I said, I need a job!
Why don't you call your friend Peter?
It's true! Please believe me!
Please calm down.

I want to tell you the truth.
I want you out of this office immediately.

When will Baoling talk to Mark again? later.

Hi, you must be Baoling!
Great to meet you, Baoling.
Shall we sit here?
Would you like a drink?
Just water will be fine.
Are you having a good time in New York?
Are you here with your husband, or is it just a business trip?
I'm divorced.
It's a nice ring, so I still wear it.

See this dress here: what's your best price?
You can have them for eighty dollars.
That's a bit high, I'm afraid. 
We have to start low, and then we can go higher.
I'm looking at thirty-forty, no more.
I need to think about it.
Sure you do.(你当然懂)
I am talking to someone else too, a big store.
It was great to meet you. 
Let's talk again, shall we? 
So long then.

I had a Chinese name when I was in China.
