I'm from Hong Kong, and I came here when I was four.
I have pretty good background in the English language, since I learned in the school for nineteen years.
At home, my mom speaks only Chinese, so I still have to use my first language there.
But when the words get too hard, then I go back to the English, which is more my native language now.

I think it's really multicultural, compared to a lot of other cities that we've been to.
There are a lot of people from a lot of different places.
And people have been always friendly to us.
