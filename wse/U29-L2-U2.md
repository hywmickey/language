Have they kidnapped you or something?
他们把你绑架了还是怎么着？
There's a diner just around the block, we'll go there.
Would you mind giving me some sort of explanation?
I'll tell you everything when we get to the diner.
It's only a short way's away.
This glass is filthy, would you mind bringing me a clean one, please?
They don't even wash the dishes properly.

This place looks totally disgusting!
What are you having?
Please yourself.
toast and coffee.
a bottle of orange juice.
I have an egg, over easy.
我要一只两面煎的鸡蛋。
We don't do bottles we only do cans.
toast and coffee.
Here's your egg and toast, Coffee's coming up.

Please don't talk to me as if I was a child, I'm grown up now, I'm almost twenty-four years old, and I see things differently from when I was a child.
When I was younger, I used to think you were some kind of superman!
I used to think, "I've got such a clever Daddy, he makes so much money, and we live in such a lovely apartment, and we go on all these expensive vacations."
It's just that I've grown up now, and I see things differently from when I was a child.
As I said, I'm an adult now, not a child.
I hate to say this, but I don't want to become like you.
Just try to see it my way.
They don't even wash the dishes properly.
You're such a snob!
snob:势利小人
So it's snobbish to want to be clean, is it?
所以爱干净还成势利眼了，是吧？

For you happiness just means having lots of money, doesn't it?
And what's so terrible about having money?
I'd be very happy to buy you whatever you wanted.
And I'm not going to go and marry some successful robot, that I don't care about!
Did I say anything when you broke up with Martin?
I've heard enough of this nonsense! I'm going!
我听够了这些废话！我要走了！
I suppose your boyfriend has taught you all this nonsense.
我猜这些无稽之谈都是你男朋友教你的。
I've seen what it's done to you.
我已经看到它给你造成的影响了。
I'm sorry about some of the things I said.
You said exactly what I thought you'd say.

Don't you care anymore what I think or what I feel?
I don't know how to say this, and I can see things now that I couldn't see then.
我不知道该怎么说，但现在我能看清以前看不到的东西了。

Let me remind you what my horrible money has done for you.
You did that very expensive interpreters' course, and I paid for it.
I didn't understand what was going on in those days.


John, would you mind talking out the garbage?
Annie, would you mind giving me a good explanation?
Would they mind sitting next to us?
Does Hugo mind if Annie moves away?
Do they mind if we smoke?
No, I don't mind if you do.
Would you mind bringing me a clean glass?
Please! Would you mind speaking more quietly?

This is such a terrible restaurant!
I've never seen such dity glasses!
This orange is so fresh because it isn't from a can!
He used to be so thin, but now he's very fat!
He's such a fat man!
You're such an incredible father!
It's so hot! Please open a window!
That woman is so funny!

if you want breakfast, there's a diner just around the block.
Could I have a cup of coffee, please?
Yes, and I would like toast with butter, and one fried egg please.
How would you like your egg cooked, madam?
Over easy, please.
What are you having, Sir?
Just a bottle of orange juice, please.
Here's your toast, coming up!
这是您的吐司，马上来！

The diner looks disgusting!
Hugo will eat anything the dinner hasn't made themselves.
This glass is filthy so the waitress bings Hugo a clean one.
This diner is awful! They don't wash the dishes properly.
Hugo wanted Annie to live in a clean evrironment.

Annie used to live with her father, but now she lives with her friends.
I really used to like him, but now I don't.
Sandra used to work at a bank unitl she quit her job.
She used to think her boyfriend was amazing until she saw him with another woman.
I didn't use to ride a bike unitl somebody stole my car.
They used to go on vacation every year, but now they can't because of the children.
We used to buy our food at the supermarket until we found out it was cheaper at the farmer's market.
He used to be overweight, but then he started working out.

You shouldn't speak to teenagers as if they were children!
When I was younger, I used to think you were the best father in the world!
But now that I've grown up, I see things very differently.
I'm not a kid, I'm almost 24 years old.
When I was young I used to think that money could buy happiness!
Now I'm an adult I understand that many things matter to me more than money.
In those days we used to go on expensive vacations very summer.

The Marlborough Hotel 875 Fourth Avenue 10021 New York
Dear Annie,
As I haven't hear anything from you for quite a while, I thought I'd write you this letter, just to give you my latest news.
I'm still in the hotel, as you can see. I've left someone to look after the apartment while the men are working on it.
It's a bit lonely, really, staying in this hotel, when I think about the good old days when we were living together in the apartment.
I got another postcard from David, by they way, he and Juanita have gong to Peru. I don't think they'll be back in New York until next month. They both send you their love, anyway.
The point is this, Annie, I understand that you've got to live your won life, and if you don't feel like living with your old Dad anymore, well, that's perfectly understandable too.
It's just that it would be nice to hear from you every now and then, if only to know that you're all right. Surely that's not much to ask?
Well, that's all for now, Annie. Please get in touch soon, you can get me either at the office or here. Looking forward to hearing from you.
All my love, Daddy.

Would you mind telling me why you did that?
What do you talk to me as if I was ten years old?
This house wouldn't be so filthy if you cleaned if more often!
They were only twenty years old, but they acted as if they were much older.
If you leave him a message, I'm sure he'll call you back.\
Would you mind if we went to another restaurant?
If you wanted to go on vacation, I'd be happy to give you some money.
I wouldn't go back there even if he asked me.
即使他邀请我，我也不会回去。
He keeps buying expensive stuff, as if had a lot of money.
If he asks you, don't tell him you saw me.

| I expect a good explanation, now!                            | If you talk to me as if I was a child, I will not speak to you anymore. |
| OK, I'm sorry. But would you mind trying to see it my way for once? | No, I'm a grown up now, and I see things differently from when I was younger! |
| Yes, of course, Now, what is all this about?                 | It's about the fact that I don't want to become a rich snob like you! |
| Why not? Are you trying to hurt me?                          | No, but the truth hurts sometimes!                           |
