Why does John have to drive? Saa and Dudu don't have driver's licenses.
Sasa's father works for the Public Box company.
Where are John, Sasa and Dudu drivng to? Syracuse.
Why does the policeman stop John? He didn't stop at a red light.
What is Sasa's solution to John's problem? Her father will pay for everything.
Why does the van stop working? It needs gas.
John and the group arrvie at Clive's club late.

We'd better go now.
You'd better drive.
I haven't got a driver's license.
Neither have I.
I told you, neither of us has a driver's license.
No problem. I love driving.
I used to have a car myself.
How come you've got a Plastic Box van?
How come： 怎么会, why
Sasa's Dad is the chairman.
I used to work for Plastic Box, you know.
I had my own office, and my own secretary.
You'd better come along with me.
You'd better go to a gas station and get a couple of gallons.
You'd better go straight in.
We'll stay in the van and get ready for the show.
So you'd better put all the sound equipment on the stage.

I so don't care.

Hey, this is a one-way street. And you're going the wrong way.
Cool.
Anyway, you're such a cool driver.
I don't know this part of town very well.
I'll do a U-turn.
我掉个头
How do you get to the upstate expressway from here?
从这里到北部高速公路怎么走？
I think you want to make a right at the next traffic light.
Which traffic light?
The one you just passed.

Didn't you see the light was red?
I was just asking my friends here how to get to Syracuse, when the traffic light just suddenly changed to red.
Can I see your driver's lisence?
I'm not sure where it is.
Are you insured to drive this vehicle, Mr. Berry?
您驾驶这辆车有保险吗？
Show me your insurance documents, please.
This insurance expired three months ago.

What's the matter with the engine? Maybe we're out of gas.
You didn't fill up before we left New York.
We're in the middle of a freeway.
You'll have to get some gas.
I'll stop a car and ask if they'll give us some.
Nobody's going to stop here.
We passed one about ten miles back.

How much farther is it?
I'm getting so bored.
So am I.

My Dad's so dumb.
Where the thell have you been?
And hurry up, forgot sick__!


We'd better go now since we have to be there at 7:30.
I don't have a driver's license, so you'd better drive.
We're out of gas, so you'd better go to a gas station and get a couple of gallons.
You'd better not turn right because it's a one-way street.
You'd better go straight in becuase everyone's waitting.
While we're getting ready, you'd better put all the sound equipment on the stage.
You'd better not drive since you don't have car insurance.
You drove through a red light, so you'd better go with the policeman.

Didn't you see the light was red? You should have stopped.
I was just asking my friend how to get to Syracuse when the traffic light changed to red.

I'm not sure where it is. Let me look for it.
Are you insured to drive this vehicle, Mr. Berry?
Show me your insurance documents, please.

I so don'care about your job.
My Dad's got lot of money.
You're such a cool driver. I like riding with you.
Where the hell have you been?

The New Music Weekly - 2nd April
NEW BANDS by Mike Pinhead.
It's been a good year for new bands, and one of the most interesting so far is New York duo Nervous Equipment.
Their cool and deathlike, yet at the same time violently angry, music is already a big favorite in many clubs and colleges.
Like most dance groups, they don't play any instruments as such. Instead, they use an Itsibitu 613A digital control desk, drving a parallel network of five multi-processing Pandemic sample stations.
I spoke to lead singer Sasa(whose real name, by the way, is Virginia Henderson) about Nervous Equipment and their music.
She explained: "Me and Dudu， he's the other half of the group，believe that music should really attack the listener."
"I mean, basically." says Sasa "When it comes down to it, it's like a war between the musicians and the listeners, right? You can't both win."
Well, so far Nervous Equipment have own all the way. Keep an eye on them. They could get very big indeed.

We'd better go now.
I used to have a car myself.
I used to work for Plastic Box.
I can't find the keys!
We're going to play in your brother's club.
You can make a right at the next traffic light.
I was just asking my friend here how to get to Syracuse.
Are you insured to drive this vehicle, Mr. Berry?
You'll have to get some gas.
Nobody's going to stop here.
You'd better go to a gas station and get a couple of gallons.
We are happy to present Nervous Equipment.
