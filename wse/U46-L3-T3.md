One type of climate change is called global warming, which is causing a continous rise in the Earth's temperature.

There are several theories as to why more tourists are traveling domestically.
For one thing, the cost of airline tickets is rising, making it very expensive for people to make international trips.
Another possible explanation is that tourists are taking a new interest in what their country has to offer.
People are discovering the attractions in places nearer to home. 
It's also possible that they are no longer interested in other countries.
Whatever the causes for the decline in international tourism, the world still has a lot to offer to both domestic and international visitors.

MOUNT KILIMANJARO

One might think of going to Africa on a safari to see wild animals. However, how many think of snow when Africa is first mentioned? This is even stranger if one knows that the African country with the snow is located close to the equator. In fact, this is stranger still if one learns that the lowest temperature is usually no colder than 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Well, such a country exists and its name is Tanzania, and the temperature cited is true for most of the land, except for one distince point. That point is Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain Africa, with a height of 19, 340 feet.

Because of this country's rich wildlife, excellent climate, wonderful coastal position, and, of course, its unique mountain, Tanzania receives about 700,000 tourists each year. Tanzania is visited by people from all corners of the globe. Because of the steady tourism which is increasing annually, Tanzania's economy has also increased in recent years. However, most of this wealth does not reach the poor, who have not seen much improvement in their standard of living. Regardless, the government is quite happy iwth its tourism success and the revenue from tourists, but even they cannot stop one of their national treasures from being endangered. Normally, when talk of extinction arises, one thinks of animals or plants: however, in this case, it is ice.

Global warming is causing the ice at Mount Kilimanjaro to disappear. Global warming is the slow rise of the earth's temperature resulting from gas emissions that trap the sun's heat in the earth's atmosphere. Basically, that means the earth is getting warmer, and as it gets warmer, ice blocks known as glaciers, and cold areas filled with ice and snow are in danger of melting. The research conducted on the status of Mount Kilimanjaro really brings this crisis to light. Researchers at Ohio State University have warned that the famous ice fields on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania might melt, and current solid research shows that their prediction is sadly becoming reality. In fact, Greenpeace, an internationally well-known environmental conservation agency, as well as experts have said that there will be no more ice or snow atop Mt. Kilimanjaro by sometime between 2015 to 2020.

Not only would this bode negatively for the economy of Tanzania, which relies heavily on its revenues from the tourists who come to Tanzania especially to see the mountain peak, but it could be especially disastrous for the many people who live at the foothills of the mountain. The lands near that mountain depend on the ice from the mountain for water. However, if there is no ice, there is no water. And, if there is no ice, there will be no reason for tourists to come to Kilimanjaro. And if there are no tourists, there is no money. As a result, the little money that the government does share with the poor will decrease even more.

The leading glaciologist to study Mt. Kilimanjaro has been Dr. Lonnie Thompson, a professor at Ohia State University. He has been able to determine just how much of Kilimanjaro's ice has disappeared. He estimates that about 82 percent of the ice fields were lost between 1912, when they were initially documented, and 2000. He also reported that the tops of the ice fields had shrunk by at least nearly 56 feet since 1962 - resulting in an average annual decrease in height of about a half meter.

Thompson's most recent journey reported the following shocking evidence:

A 164-foot high wall of ice has retreated about 16 feet since 2002 at three points on the border of the northern ice field.

In two of the mountain's ice bodies - Furtwangler Glacier and the northern ice field - a massive hole that reaches through the ice down to the bedrock has formed which will most likely split the northern ice field in two in the next two years and the Furtwangler Glacier in the next six months.

The northern ice field has lost 6.5 feet of ice from the surface, the Furtwangler has lost more than 10 feet, and the southern ice fields have lost between 13 and 16.5 feet.

Thompson said that the loss of more than 10 feet from the surface of the Furtwangler is serious since that entire glacier was only 30 feet thick in 2000. To make matters worse, there has been no new ice on any of those ice fields since 2000, which makes the amount of lost ice enormous.

Environmentalists are trying their best to slow down the effects of glooal warming, but most of the world is not listening. The question which remains is what will the people do when the water disappears, as it most likely will.

There's nothing like the experience of seeing fresh, pure white snow covering the peaks of a mountain range.
However, all over the world, this vision of beauty is in danger of disappearing.
Thanks to global warming, snow-capped mountains may become a thing of the past.
Global warming is causing snow, ice, and glaciers everywhere to melt.
This source of the problem is in the inhabitans of the Earth.
Pollution and man-made waste are sending toxing into the air, raising the temperature around the globe.
And it is not just the glaciers and ice that are suffering.
Another result is that sea levels are rising, and fresh water sources are disappearing with the disappearing ice.
The global climate is changing, causing more storms, and more violent weather.
It may be too late to stop the damage that we humans have caused.
And in the end, we may all pay for our mistakes.
