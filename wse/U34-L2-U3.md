Look, I apologize about your homework.
I don't seem to have it with me.
我好像没带在身上。
I must have left it at home.
我肯定把它忘在家里了。

I don't care about my homework. Nor do you.
我不在乎我的作业，你也一样。
That's what I'm employed for.
这就是我受雇的目的。

You're not satisfied with your work, and you're not all satisfied with your life.
How did you guess?
I can tell by looking into your eyes.
There are several things I'd rather do than teach English.
I'd quite like to be a writer, fot instance.
例如，我非常想成为一名作家。
We only have one life and one chance to be happy. Why throw it away?
我们只有一次生命，一次追求幸福的机会。为什么要浪费它呢？
I believe we should all do what we feel like doing, and to hell with what other people think!
我认为我们都应该做自己想做的事，至于别人怎么想，管他呢！
“to hell with” 是口语化表达，意为 “让…… 见鬼去、不在乎”，翻译时用 “管他呢” 还原其洒脱不羁的语气。

As you know, I'm not really satisfied, just being an English teacher.
I'd really much rather be a writer.
我真的很想当作家。
Well, I'm not stopping you.
What are you driving at, David?
大卫，你想干什么？

I told her you were talking to one of your students.
Yes, Melissa was worried about her grammar.
I was just chatting to one of the students about her pronunciation.
I mean, her grammer ... his grammar.
我是说，她的语法…… 哦不，是他的语法。
Darling, can you get some more diaper for the baby on the way home?
We're completely out of them.
Come home soon, darling.
Bye-bye, honey!
Daddy'll be back soon with some nice new clean diapers!

I'm afarid Mr.Peters has just left.
I can give you his phone number, if you like.

I'd like to speak to David Peters, please.
He's not back yet. Who is this?
Look, I'll call again a bit later, OK?

Are you having an affair with one of your students?
She was only asking me about her pronunciation.

So who's Kristi!
She called a couple of minutes ago asking to speak to you.
She wouldn't tell me who she was or what she wanted.
I promise you, I've never met her.
Then how did she get your phone number?
She must have called the shcool, I guess.

You just ask your Dad to lend us fifty thousand or so, and then I can leave the school and try writing for a living.
你只要让你爸爸借给我们五万左右，然后我就可以离开学校，试着以写作为生。
or so: 大约，…左右，…上下
We're not borrowing any more, and that's that!
我们不再借钱了，就这样定了！
“that's that!” 是口语化固定表达，意为 “就这样定了、没商量”，体现出坚决不容更改的语气。
If you're not happy with your work, that's your problem. You deal with it!
如果你对自己的工作不满意，那是你自己的事，你自己解决！

I called a short while ago, and sopke to some awful, angry woman.
不久前，我打电话给一个可怕的、愤怒的女人。
She must have been your landlady, I guess.
I'm an old friend of your sister Annie's, but we've lost touch with each other， and we haven't seen each other for several years.
I was wondering if you could give me her email and phone number.
Can you just hold on while I get a pen?
Her mobile number is 368-555-9921, and her landline is 222-555-5434.
landline:固定电话
I don't have her email. I think she's changed it recently.

She just wanted to get in touch with Annie, that's all.
I wonder why.
She's probaly a cop, with all the stuff Annie gets involved in.
她很可能是个警察，毕竟安妮卷入了那么多乱七八糟的事。


I don't seem to have your homework with me, I must have left it at home.
How did she get your phone number? She must have called the school, I guess.
I called a short while ago and spoke to some woman. She must have been your landlady, I guess.
I seem to have lost Annie's address. I must have forgotten to put it in my address book.
Juanita seems to have been angry about Kristi's phone call. She must have thought the woman was David's lover.

It seems stupid for me to spend all my time teaching.
We're not borrowing any more money, and that's that.

I'm looking for an old friend of mine, David Peters.
We lost touch with each other after I married.
I was wondering if you could give me his email and phone number.
Can you just hold on while I get a pen?
His cell phone number is 368-555-9921.
His landline is 222-555-5434.
I'm sorry but I don't have his email address.
I think he's changed it recently.

Juanita and David are Sigismonda's Mommy and Daddy.
Juanita asks David to buy some new diapers for the baby.
David calls his wife "honey".
Juanita calls Sigismonda her treasure.
treasure: 心肝宝贝儿
Daddy'll be back soon with some clean diapers.

Dear David,
For our homework this week you told us to write a short story, here is mine:
Once upon a time, there was a handsome young man called Peter. He lived in New York and worked as an English teacher.
He didn't enjoy his job very much. He got very bored with his students, who were often slow and stupid, and sometimes he used to close his eyes and see a quite different world in his imagination.
In this world, Peter could see himself on a beautiful far-away island, with lovely girls all around him, he was rich, successful and happy.
Then, Peter would make up and see that he was in his usual classroom in cold, dirty old New York, and his eyes became so sad and lonely that all the girl students in his class felt sorry for him and  wanted to look after him.
Then, one day, a new student came into the class, she was called Selima, She saw that sad, far-away look in Peter's eyes, and she knew just how he was feeling.
Slima fell in love with Peter too, but she didn't feel sorry for him, like the other girls did. You see, she had realized what Peter's problem was. He was afraid to do what he knew he should do. He was afraid to listen to his heart and to follow it, whatever it would take him.
The end of his story hasn't been written yet, has it? Melissa Karageorgis.

| You're not satisfied with your work, and you're not at all statisfied with your life. | How did you guess? I mean, what makes you think that?        |
| I can tell by looking into your eyes.                        | Well, you're right. There are serveral things I'd rather do than teach English. |

| Why throw it away?                                           |                                                              |
| In the end, I believe we should all do what we feel like doing and to hell with what other people think! |                                                              |

| I told your wife you were talking to one of your students.   | Yes, Melissa was worried about her grammar.         |
| Did you see the news last night?                             | No, I was working late and missed it.               |
| I was just chatting to one of the students about her pronunciation. | I mean, her grammar ... his grammar.                |
| Are you having an affair with one of your students?          | No! She was only asking me about her pronunciation. |
| Why didn't you answer the phone?                             | The baby was crying and I didn't hear it ring.      |
| I was talking with my wife, Melissa.                         | I mean, Juanita.                                    |

The baby was crying and I didn't hear it ring.

hear + 宾语 + 不带 to 的不定式（动词原形）

此处 ring 作宾语 it 的补足语，属于动词用法。

即便 it 是第三人称单数，也无需变形成 rings，因为这里的动词形式由前面的感官动词 hear 决定，而非宾语的单复数。
