It's all part of the service, as they say.
Maybe just refer to them as "tourists".
it's all part of the service, as you said earlier.
I've got something else to do, as it happens.


You can claim the subway ticket as a travel expense.

So how do you get to this bar?
Well, as I said, it's in Chelsea: West 22nd Street, near Madison Square Park.
Just tell your driver to take Broadway going north, and then make a left onto West 23rd Street immediately before Madison Square Park.
告诉司机沿着百老汇向北行驶，然后在麦迪逊广场公园前立即左转进入西23街。
Then, park anywhere along West 23rd.

One of my clients refused to get into bed.
Why are we standing around in this crowed lobby?
为什么我们站在这个拥挤的大厅里？

So, how much longer will you be staying in New York?
Just two more days, that's all.

Unfortunately, I've got to go out with some of the students this evening.
It's a real drag, you know.
真是麻烦透顶了，你知道吧。
I thought you said they'd gone to Riverside Park.
They're coming back this evening, especially for this.
It's one of my duties as a teacher to entertain the students.
You know I hate doing it.
because the students went on excursion to Riverside Park.
因为学生们去河畔公园郊游了。
excursion:远足;短途旅行;涉足;涉猎

Then why do you keep on doing it?
Why do you keep on teaching at that school, complaining to me all the time, but never doing anything about it?
I thought you were capable of doing great things!
我以为你能做伟大的事情！

But I was wrong, David! You're not a real man.
You're just a weak, frightened little boy!
你不过是个软弱、胆小的小家伙！
When are you going to do something with your life?
你什么时候开始为自己的生活做点什么？
Is that all you can think of saying?
你就只能想到说这个吗？
Look darling, maybe if we just talked about this...
亲爱的，你看，或许我们只要好好谈谈这件事……

I was going to ask you to join me this evening for a drink.
Where do you have in mind?
Can you think of any really typical New York bars we__ should_ go to?
"Romeo's" in Chelsea. That's got a nice intimate atmosphere.
切尔西的罗密欧餐厅。那里的氛围非常温馨。
Anyway, let me introduce you.
Mr. Yasuhiro, this is David Peters, my former English teacher.
How do you do?
And lastly, this is Mr. Oshima.
I'm dying for a drink.
Can I get you anything, Aiko?
爱子，我有什么可以帮您的吗？


You shouldn't refer to your students as fools/idiots.
你不应该把学生称为傻瓜 / 白痴。
As I said, my house is on Elm Street.
As you always say, practice makes perfect.
I was going to the supermarket anyway, as it happens.

You can claim phone calls as a business expense.

So, how do I get to your apartment?
Well, as I said, it's in the Hargrove neighborhood.
East 32nd Street, near Riverland Park.
Just tell your driver to take Maple Street going north.
告诉你的司机沿着枫木街向北行驶。
Then, make a left onto West 23rd Street.
That's just before Riverland Park.

Tokyo, Japan 12th March
Dear Annie, I know this will come as an enormous surprise to you. I hope it will be a pleasant, rather than an upleasant one.
As you can see, I didn't die in Trinidad, although I came very close to it, and I have taken the opportunity during these past few years to look at my life and what really matters to me.
I have now realized that my only goal in life for as long as I can remember has been to make money, paying no attention to my relationships with other people.
This is why your mother left me, and this was why I was on the point of losing contact with both you and David.
I want you to understand first of all that I have decided to change, Annie, because I have realized how much I really care about you and David.
For various obvious reasons, I can't tell you in this letter how to get in touch with me, but I'll try and get a personal message to you or David in the next couple of weeks.
You will easily understand that I may not be able to come to New York myself, but I hope we can meet somewhere not too far away.
I'm sure you have hundreds of questions to ask me. I look forward to answering them more than I can tell you in words. Your loving father.

God, there are a lot of people in this place! Why is it so crowded?
I'd rather go to a nice, quiet restaurant where we can have a more intimate dinner.
The company's representative gave me a brouchure describing the product.
He can't stop flirting with other women, even though his wife's with him.
I've already said I was sorry. Why can't you forgive me?
Sorry, I dropped my pencil on the floor; I must just pick it up.
Can I keep the bill? I need to claim it as a business expense.
He doesn't do as well in college as he's capable of doing.
That is a great place for our wedding, In fact, it's ideal.
What an exhausting life; working all day and partying all night!
I refuse to give money to people who are too lazy to work.
We need four bowls; we're having soup to start with.
