You've got a bicycle now, I see.
It's much better for you than going by car.
Really, I prefer going by car.
But I sold my car, you see.
And I only get $500 for it.
That's why I have to go by bike.
Now that I don't work at Plastic Box anymore.
I can't afford a car.

You fell off your bicycle, dear. Shall I call an ambulance.
I have to leave the bike here and take the bus.
I've just had a really terrible accident on my bicycle.
I almost died.

I'm taking the highway to Chicago, and I don't want to have to stop.
So fill it up.
Now, where's the bathroom?
Go past the office, and it's on your right.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You're putting gasoline in my tank!
Where did you want me to put it?

It's this fool attendent of yours.
First he showed me to he ladies's toilet, and then he filled my tank with gas!
Haven't you learned yet that you put diesel in a truck.

Was that some kind of joke? You showed me to the ladies' room.
Is there a problem?
Yes, there damn well is___!

I'm sorry, sir, what have I done wrong?

I won't make that mistake again, believe, me!
You mon't get a chance to make it again.
You're fired.
Maybe I can clean the cars.
I'll put air in their tires and water in their radiators(散热器).

Riding a bike is hard work.
I like learning english.
Eating at home is healthier than at restaurants.
Buying a car is more expensive than taking the bus.

Big trucks use diesel.
Another word for gasoline is gas.
John fills up the truck.
You turn the key to pen the tank.
I can clean the cars.
I'll put air in their tires.

I don't like to take cabs. They are very expensive.
I'll have to leave the bike here and take the public bus.
A Rolls Royce is a very expensive car.
You put diesel in a truk.

What a shame!
Look where you're going!
Oh, no! What am I going to do?
Take it easy!
Wask that some kind of joke?
Hey, what the hell you do you think you're doing?
Just get out of here.

Why don't you come away with me?
Fill up the truck.
Don't put gasoline in!
Open up the tank.
Go past the office.
Just get out.

I've just had a really terrible accident on my bicycle.
You need to go to the hospital.
You have to see a doctor.
You're lucky you are alive.

Dear Mr.Berry
I am writing to you about an incident that happened at the Go West Gas Station on Wednesday March 19th.
You will of course remember that at that time you were an attendant at the gas station, employed by my client Mr.Bert Cashbox.
My client tells me that a truck belonging to the Assoil Fuel Corporation came into the Go West Gas Station on that morning, and the drive asked you to fill the tank.
You filled his tank with gasoline, my client tells me, and he has just had a letter from the lawyer of the Assoil Fue Corporation asking for $12850 to pay for the damage to the truck.
I am asking you, Mr Berry, to pay this, plus my own costs, which comes to $20,000 in all. I am sure you would not like me to put this into anyone else's hands. If you see what I mean.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Yours.
N.G.Sinistri

Please put the book on the table.
The boy fell off his bed.
Marco had English class on Tuesday.
Lei almost died in the accident yesterday.
Mary showed Kristi the bus stop.
The waiter filled the glass with wine.
Haven't you learned another language?
Mr.Beacon fired Viktor.
Haven't you slod your car?
Haven't you been to the United States?
I have no money so I can't afford a vacation.
I thought John worked here.
