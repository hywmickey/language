You left me alone for over a minute then.
然后你让我一个人呆了一分钟多。
What if I just walked out of the store?
You would have lost a customer.
I went to China with my boyfriend last summer, and every place you go the salespeople keep bothering you.
So I figure, if the customer wants help she'll ask; if she doesn't, I'll leave her alone.
It's about making a relationship with the customer.
You don't want to annoy them or bother them, of course. But make contact with them in a friendly way.
当然，你肯定不想惹恼他们，也不想打扰他们。但还是要以友好的方式和他们接触。
make contact with： 与…… 取得联系、接触

I don't want to argue with you, Marie.
If you're working for me, you do things my way, OK?
如果你为我工作，你就按照我的方式做事，好吗？
Chinese management style, right?
They're salesgirls, not senior managers.
I don't want to have a long discussion with them every day.
I just need them to do as they're told.
If you took on older and more experienced staff, you'd hardly need to train them at all, just get them familiar with the products.
如果你雇佣了年龄较大、经验丰富的员工，你几乎不需要对他们进行培训，只需要让他们熟悉产品。
Here in the US people expect to be given more responsibility.
在美国，人们希望被赋予更多的责任。


I brought some documents for you to sign.
So where are these documents for me to sign, then?
那么，这些文件在哪里让我签字呢？

I'm just doing some trainning.
I can break for a few minutes.
Mr. Connors is going to watch our training session.
training session: 培训课程
So we'll carry on from where we left off.
所以我们就从上次中断的地方继续进行。
Better get on with it.
最好继续做下去。


There are some dishes in the kitchen for Albert to wash.
Ms. Nielsen. Could you please go to the bank? I have some checks for you to cash.
尼尔森女士。你能去银行吗？我有一些支票要你兑现。
There are some papers for Mrs. Murata to look at.
The salesgirl has chosen serveral suits for me to try on.
Here's some money for you to buy tickets to the concert.
Here's the phone number for you to call.

If a salesperson leaves me alone in a store for a long time, I might just walk out of the store.
When salespeople keep bothering me, I think they are really pushy.
I'll just ask a salesperson if I need help.
It's not pushy to make contact with a customer in a friendly way.
Being friendly, but neutral with coustomers is the way to sell.
You can make a customer feel good about himself by telling him an item will suit him well.
你可以告诉顾客一件适合他的东西，让他对自己感觉良好。

I don't want to do things your way. You think you are always right, but you aren't.
Please just do as you're told. I don't want to change every detail every five minutes.
Your management style is quite different than what I'm used to. I'm usually given a bit more responsibility.
You can't just do what you want. I'm the senior manager, and you need to follow what I tell you to do.
I don't need you to make decisions about the products, I just want you to be familiar with the situation.
I don't want my employees to argue with me. I just want them to do what I ask them.

Let's talk
A new colleague of yours(Mr Thomas Morton) is starting work today. When you arrive in the morning you find him sitting in your office.
Introduce yourself to him, and then politely explain his mistake to him, and tell him how to find his own office.
As he leaves, he lights a cigarette; ask him politely not to smoke, explaining that there is a no smoking rule in your company.

Later on the same morning you bring some documents to Mr Morton, which you would like him to read.
Knocking on the door, you explain who you are, and why you have come, and ask to come in.
After you have given him the documents, he wants to know if there's someone who brings you tea or coffee in your office.
You explain to him that you can get it for yourself from a machine whenever you like. Since it's his first day with you, you then kindly offer to go and get him a tea or coffee, asking him...

At about one o'clock you pass Mr Morton on the way to lunch.
He stops you and asks for your advice on a reasonable place to have lunch in the area.
You ask him whether he wants to go somewhere very good, or somewhere fairly economical.
When he tells you, suggest the name of a possible place for him to go to, and explain how to get there.
At this point he asks you if you would like to join him for lunch.
You agree to do so(although you don't particulary look forward to it!), and ask him to wait for you while you get your coat.

You come back to Mr Morton, having got your coat.
Ask him to come with you, saying that you will show him the way to the restaurant where you are going to eat.
Out in the street, you tell him that the restaurant is just across the road from where you are now standing.
Mr Morton starts to cross the road, not having noticed that a bus is coming. Do what is necessary to avoid having to advertise his position again next week!
Once in the restaurant you advise him what to choose from the menu, and explain that you never drink alcohol at lunch.

His management style is to be very hands on.
他的管理风格是非常亲力亲为的。
We are going to start from zero, that means that we are going to start with the training from the very beginning.
from the very beginning: 从最开始、从源头、从零基础
beginning: 本身就是名词，意思是 “开始、开端”
Your job as a salesgirl is to assist customers and take their money.
When there is a problem at work, managers have to look into the cause of it so that they can solve it.
当工作中出现问题时，管理者必须调查问题的原因，以便能够解决它。、
look into： 调查、探究，深入了解问题、查找根源
cause: 原因

Managers have to deal with many things such as training, hiring, interviewing, selling, and evaluating.
When there is an accident at work, a manager needs to record it on his or her daily report.
It is part of a manager's responsibility to make sure his or her employees are happy.
When a manager is not around, there needs to be an assistant manager to take care of things.
I will be right back, can someone keep an eye on my things so that they don't get stolen?
The employees and the boss have a very good relationship. They both show a lot of respect toward each other.

解析一下carry on和left off

结合日常和职场高频场景，我会用简单语言拆解“carry on”和“left off”的核心用法，再搭配具体例子，帮你快速理解和复用：

一、carry on：核心是“继续/坚持”，分3种常用场景
“carry on”是动词短语，字面可理解为“带着（某事）继续走”，实际用法围绕“不中断、接着做”展开，根据语境有细微区别：

1. 最常用：继续做“没完成的事”（日常/职场都适用）
指暂停后接着做之前的事，比如继续开会、继续工作、继续说话等，后面可接“with sth”或直接接动词-ing。  
- 例子1（职场）：The meeting was interrupted by a call, and we’ll **carry on with the discussion** after lunch.（会议被一个电话打断了，我们午饭后继续讨论。）  
- 例子2（日常）：Don’t stop—**carry on reading** until you finish the paragraph.（别停，继续读，直到读完这一段。）

2. 特殊：坚持做“有难度的事”（含“咬牙坚持”的意味）
指遇到困难仍不放弃，语气比“continue”更强调“毅力”。  
- 例子：Even though the project is tough, we have to **carry on** until it’s done.（虽然这个项目很难，但我们必须坚持做完。）

3. 口语场景：“举止不当/吵闹”（偏负面，日常对话用）
指人“瞎闹、举止粗鲁”，多用来制止别人的不当行为，是比较随意的表达。  
- 例子：Stop **carrying on** like a child—everyone is trying to work!（别像个小孩一样瞎闹了，大家都在工作呢！）


二、left off：核心是“中断的位置/状态”，必须搭配“where”
“left off”是动词短语“leave off”的过去分词形式，字面是“留下、停下”，实际只用来表示“之前做到一半停下的地方/状态”，**几乎都和“where”连用**（构成“where sb left off”），不能单独使用。

它的作用是“明确接续的起点”，比如上次会议停在哪个议题、上次看书看到哪一页，避免重复说“上次没做完的地方”。  
- 例子1（学习）：I can’t remember **where I left off** in this textbook—can you help me find the page?（我不记得这本课本上次看到哪了，你能帮我找下页码吗？）  
- 例子2（工作）：The new colleague will **carry on from where the previous one left off** (with the project).（新同事会从之前那位同事中断的地方，继续推进这个项目。）

三、高频搭配：carry on + left off 一起用
这两个短语经常搭配出现，构成“**carry on from where sb left off**”，是“从上次中断处继续”的固定表达，职场（如培训、项目）和日常（如学习、家务）都极常用，比如你之前遇到的句子：  

> So we'll **carry on from where we left off**.（所以我们就从上次中断的地方继续进行。）  

再比如日常场景：Let’s **carry on from where we left off** with the movie—we stopped at the 40-minute mark yesterday.（咱们从昨天中断的地方继续看电影吧，昨天看到40分钟那儿了。）


总结一下：  
- 想表达“继续做某事”，用 **carry on**（根据场景选“继续未完成的事”“坚持难事”或“制止吵闹”）；  
- 想明确“从上次中断处开始”，用 **where we left off**，且几乎都会和“carry on from”搭配。

为什么不是：I don't want to do things in your way.

你的疑问特别好！其实 **“I don't want to do things in your way”语法上完全正确**，不是错句——但日常英语中，我们更习惯说“your way”（省略in），核心原因是：**英语里“way”表示“做事方式”时，接“所有格（如your/his/her）”或“名词”时，“in”可以省略，且省略后更简洁、更口语化，是母语者的自然选择**。


用通俗的话拆解，就像中文里的“习惯表达”：我们说“按你的方式做”，不会刻意说“用你的方式做”——不是“用”错了，而是“按”更自然；英语里“your way”就是这种“更自然的省略”，具体可以从3个角度理解：


1. 先明确：“in your way”本身没错，只是“没必要加in”
当“way”表示“做事的方法、方式”时，“in + one’s way”是标准用法（比如“in this way”“in a new way”），但如果“way”前面是 **“所有格”**（比如your/his/her/my/our，或名词所有格如“the boss’s way”“Tom’s way”），“in”就成了“可选项”——加不加都对，但母语者会主动省略，因为更简洁。

比如：
- 加in：Do it **in your way**.（用你的方式做。）  
- 省略in：Do it **your way**.（按你的方式做。）  
两句话意思完全一样，但第二句更像日常聊天的语气，第一句反而有点“刻意、绕弯子”的感觉，就像中文里说“用你的方式来做”，不如“按你的方式做”顺口。


2. 对比：什么时候“in”不能省？（帮你分清边界）
只有当“way”前面不是“所有格”，而是 **普通名词、形容词或冠词**（如the/a/this/that）时，“in”才不能省。这能帮你理解“省略in”的前提——必须是“way + 所有格”的组合。

比如：
- 正确：Do it **in the right way**（way前是“the right”，不是所有格，in不能省）  
- 正确：Solve it **in a new way**（way前是“a new”，不是所有格，in不能省）  
- 正确：We did it **in Tom’s way**（way前是“Tom’s”，所有格，in可省，也能说“We did it Tom’s way”）  


3. 日常场景：为什么“your way”更常用？
英语母语者在交流时，特别追求“高效、不啰嗦”——能少一个词就少一个词，只要不影响理解。“your way”比“in your way”少了一个“in”，但意思完全没丢，所以日常对话（比如朋友聊天、同事沟通、家人商量）里，几乎都用省略in的版本。

比如你之前的句子场景（拒绝对方的做事方式）：
- 说“I don't want to do things your way”，听的人立刻能懂，语气自然；  
- 说“I don't want to do things in your way”，虽然没错，但会让人感觉你在“刻意组织语言”，反而不够放松，像在说书面语。


总结一下：  
不是“不能加in”，而是“加了in没必要，且不自然”——就像中文里不说“我不想用你的方式做事”，而说“我不想按你的方式做事”一样，是母语者长期形成的“简洁习惯”。只要记住：**“way + 所有格（your/his等）”时，in可省，日常优先用省掉的版本**，就能和母语者说得一样自然～

cause 和 reason 在表示 “原因” 上有什么区别？

在表示“原因”时，**cause和reason的核心区别在于“侧重点”和“使用场景”** ——简单说：  
- **cause更像“客观导火索”**：指直接导致某个“结果”（比如问题、事故、现象）的具体因素，偏客观、可追溯；  
- **reason更像“主观解释”**：指用来解释“某个行为、观点或选择”的理由，偏主观、带逻辑说明。  

不用复杂术语，结合日常和职场例子，帮你彻底分清：


一、核心区别：“导致结果” vs “解释行为”
这是最关键的判断标准，记住两句话：  
- 想表达“什么东西直接导致了某个结果”→ 用 **cause**；  
- 想表达“为什么要做某件事/为什么有某个想法”→ 用 **reason**。  

1. cause：客观“导火索”，连接“因”和“果”
- 特点：必须对应一个明确的“结果”（如问题、故障、疾病、事故等），是“结果的直接诱因”，偏客观事实，不带主观判断。  
- 常用搭配：**the cause of + 结果**（结果通常是负面或中性的事件/现象）。  
- 例子：  
  - 职场：The **cause** of the system crash is a software bug.（系统崩溃的原因是一个软件漏洞。）→ “系统崩溃”是结果，“软件漏洞”是直接导致它的客观原因（cause）。  
  - 日常：Doctors are still trying to find the **cause** of his illness.（医生还在努力寻找他生病的原因。）→ “生病”是结果，“病因”是客观存在的cause。  

2. reason：主观“解释”，连接“行为/观点”和“理由”
- 特点：对应“人的行为、选择或观点”，是“为什么这么做/这么想”的逻辑说明，偏主观想法或逻辑依据。  
- 常用搭配：**the reason for + 行为/观点** 或 **the reason (that/why) + 句子**。  
- 例子：  
  - 职场：What’s your **reason** for choosing this solution?（你选择这个解决方案的理由是什么？）→ “选择方案”是行为，“reason”是解释这个行为的主观依据。  
  - 日常：My **reason** for being late is that the bus broke down.（我迟到的理由是公交车坏了。）→ “迟到”是行为，“公交车坏了”是解释这个行为的理由（reason）。  


二、关键搭配：从“和什么词一起用”快速区分
两者的常用搭配完全不同，记住这些固定组合，就不会用混：

| 维度         | cause（客观原因）                | reason（主观理由）                |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 核心搭配     | the cause **of** + 结果（如problem, accident） | the reason **for** + 行为（如choice, delay）；the reason (why/that) + 句子 |
| 常用动词     | find out the cause（找出原因）、identify the cause（确认原因）、investigate the cause（调查原因） | give a reason（给出理由）、explain the reason（解释理由）、have a reason（有理由） |
| 否定表达     | no cause for sth（无需为某事担心，如no cause for alarm“无需恐慌”） | no reason to do sth（没理由做某事，如no reason to be angry“没理由生气”） |


三、易错点：什么时候绝对不能互换？
举两个典型错误例子，帮你避开坑：  
1. 错误：What’s the **cause** for you being late?（×）  
   正确：What’s the **reason** for you being late?（√）  
   原因：“being late”是“行为”，需要“解释行为的理由”，用reason；cause只能对应“结果”（如the cause of the delay“延误的原因”，这里“延误”是结果）。  

2. 错误：The **reason** of the fire is a cigarette end.（×）  
   正确：The **cause** of the fire is a cigarette end.（√）  
   原因：“the fire”是“结果”（火灾这个事件），需要“导致结果的直接原因”，用cause；reason不能对应“客观结果”。  


四、简单记忆法：一句话分清
- 看到“结果”（如问题、事故、疾病）→ 想“导致它的是啥”→ 用 **cause**；  
- 看到“行为/想法”（如选择、迟到、观点）→ 想“为啥这么做/这么想”→ 用 **reason**。  

比如之前你翻译的句子里：“managers have to look into the cause of it”（管理者必须调查问题的原因），这里“it”指“工作中的问题”（结果），所以用cause，完美符合它的用法～
