I just need a bit more time to talk over with him.
talk over with:与交谈，洽商
Come to the point, Hugo.
Come to the point：说到点子上，有话直说
It's just going to take a bit of__ time, that's all. Not long.
What do you mean by not long.
Say, two weeks, perhaps less.
Do you think I'm going to wait two weeks, with half of caps in New York looking for me?
I've done my best, belive me!
Believe you?! That's almost funny.
No, don't do that! Anything but that!
I'll try and get you half of a million by tomorrow.
I've got to stop him.

It's time to cut the cake!
I'm ready to cake the cut. I mean, cut the cake!
Oh look, that's very funny!
David's got a spoon instead of a knife.
You can't cut a cake with a spoon, David!
Here you are, you can use my knife.
Thanks, very kind of you.
We've made it! I've cut the cake.
Everybody help yourselves!

Where were we sitting?
We were sitting next to your father over there.
He's not there anymore; where's he gone?
How should I know?

I'm going to have to go away for a few days.
Well, we're flying back to Mexico tomorrow, so bye-bye for now!
And we must keep in touch.

Bye-bye, my lovely new father-in-law!
Have a good honeymoon, won't you?

Why haven't you kept in touch?
You told me not to bother you, sir.
But that was 5 days ago.
Well done! I knew you were the right man for the job.


Can they fix it themselves.
Annie and David often see each other.
I can't help all of you. You need to do it yourselves.
You should tell Annie yourself.
I don't need you. I can do it myself.
The two of you must help each other.


Wellcome! We are gathered here for the wedding of David and Juanita.
Does anyone here know of any reason why this man and this woman should not be married?
If so, let them speak now.
Who gives Juanita to be married to this man?
I do.
David, will you take Janita as your wife?
I will.
I now pronounce David and Juanita man and wife!

David and Janita are getting married.
Hugo is now Juanita's father-in-law.
David and Juanita are going to Trinidad on their honeymoon.

You should use a knife to cut the cake.

What do you mean by “this plan is risky”?（你说 “这个计划有风险”，具体指的是什么意思？）
I don’t understand. What do you mean by that?（我没明白，你那样说是什么意思？）

susan.petri@coolmail.com, Darling
I tried calling you, but your phone was switched off, so I'm seending you this email instead.
A really amazing thing has happened: Thacker's sending me to Trinidad to try to catch Hugo Peters, Roger, and "The Boss".
I'm sitting in the business lounge at JFK right now; my plane is boarding any minute now.
Just think that this could mean, my love, if it goes well. A really top job... perhaps the top job! My name could be in the papers if: "CARTER CLEAN UP THE CARIBBEAN!"
Of course, there are still one or two problems. I don't know which filght Peters is on, for example. Or maybe he's already arrived in Trinidad.
I can't find Petri either; his name isn't on the passenger list for my flight.
They've just called my flight, so I'll have to stop now. Don't worry about me, dear, I'll be alright. I'll call you from Trinidad.
All my love, Harry.

I have to go. My plane is boarding any minute now.
I'm at the airport, but I don't know which fight Peters is on.
Well, we're flying back to Mexico tomorrow, so bye-bye for now.
After the wedding, they're going to Beijing for their honeymoon.
Harry has a plane ticket. He will be one of the best passengers on the plane.
Harry is trying to catch Hugo Peters, Roger, and "The Boss."
Harry is a policeman.
Half the cops in New York are looking for Roger.
We are here to celebrate the wedding of David and Juanita.
The priest said, "I now pronounce David and Juanita man and wife!"
Put the ring on her finger.
