THE HULA

Hawaii brings to mind images of white beaches, tropical plants, and women in grass skirts with flowers in their hair, swaying gently to music. While the image of a grass-skirted woman may represent Hawaii for many, this dance, the hula, is so much more than just musical movement.

The hula dance actually finds its base in poetry, rather than music. This poetry, called mele, is the heart of the movements which are visual representations of the poems. While most believe the hula to be just a dance, it in fact has a long tradition which springs from cultural rituals and beliefs. Laka, the hula goddess, plays her role in the hula tradition. Religious rituals are dedicated to this goddess and form a part of the dancers' training. Even the plants used are an important part of the tradition. Flowers from the hula altar are used in the flower necklaces, called leis, which the dancers wear.

Although much of the ceremony and the rituals of the traditional hula dancing are dedicated to the gods of traditional Hawaiian society, the hula has also always been a form of entertainment. The myth of Pele, the goddess of the volcano, was one of the earliest known hula interpretations. This myth tells the story of Pele's younger sister, who learns a dance which she performs for Pele.

With the arrival of the American missionaries in the early 1800s, the hula and its traditions were kept in secret. Once the missionaries' censorship was lifted, the hula once again began to be brought to light. It was King Kalakaua who encouraged the rebirth of the hula, and for the next twenty years, the hula became popular once more.

The early 1900s brought an increase in tourism, and at the same time, the hula began to become known as general entertainment. With this change in focus and outside influences, the hula also began to change. A new, more western style of music was introduced to the hula, with string instruments like the ukulele and guitar accompanying the dance rather than percussion instruments like drums. 

Songs with tunes and melodies were sung with the dance, replacing the traditional chanting of before. This newer hula made its way into the movies and the media, creating a certain stereotype, at times incorrect, about the dance and culture. This stereotype still exists today.

However, in the 1970s, a desire to get back to the traditional hula, known as the hula kahiko, emerged. It did not replace the newer, westernized hula, or hula auana, but rather reappeared alongside it. Apart from the musical differences of the two styles of hula, the hula kahiko and hula auana differ in their dance style and, often, dress, The kahiko dance style tends to be much more lively and energetic while the auana is softer and more fluid. Hula kahiko dancers tend to wear more traditional native costumes or traditional skirts over western clothing, while the hula auana dancers tend to wear western clothing.

Nowadays, there are private hula schools, or halau, that train hula groups. The head instructor is responsible for all areas of the dancers training, dress, and dance presentation. Many of these master instructors also research poetio texts to motivate their students to remember the rich Hawaiian tradition and history which the poems present and inspire the dance of the hula, generations to come will appreciate and remember the rich culture and history of Hawaii.

The Basque Country of Spain is a land rich in cultural heritage.
The Basque language, and important part of his heritage, was at one time in danger of being lost.
This happened during the oppressive rule of General Franco, when the use of the language was banned.
However, it continued to be spoken in secret, behind closed doors.
Nowadays, more and more Basque people want to get back to their roots.
For example, schools and colleges have returned to teaching the Basque language.
It isn't an easy language, and learning it requires dedication and hard work.
However, thanks to this revival, the language is sure to be preserved for generations to come.
然而，得益于这次复兴，这门语言必将得以世代传承。
