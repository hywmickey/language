        主语：people
        谓语：came（核心谓语动词，表 “到来” 的动作）

THE SAHARA DESERT

The Sahara Desert, spanning a large part of North Africa, is the biggest desert in the world outside of the polar regions. It is between 800 and 1,200 miles wide and is at least 3, 000 miles long. It covers about one-third of the African continent and is mainly part of 11 countries in Africa, and is believed to be expanding. In fact, the Sahara is so big that it divides Africa into two regions. The Atlantic Ocean borders it on the west, the Red Sea on the east, and the Atlas Mountains and Mediterranean Sea on the North. The name Sahara is derived from the Arabic word meaning desert.

When one thinks of the Sahara, one thinks of sand, and that would be a fairly accurate description of the desert. However, is not just a flat expanse of sand. In fact, the highest point of the Sahara is Mount Koussi, at 11,204 feet, and the lowest part of the desert is in the Qattara Depression in Egypt at 436 feet. The Sahara consists of gravel-covered plains, shallow basins, plateaus, mountains, oases, sand sheets, dunes and sand seas. Sand sheets and dunes cover more than 25 percent of the Sahara's surface. Some of these dunes are over 600 feet high, and no one really knows how these dunes were formed. In addition to the dunes,sand also comes in another form-sandstorms. During a sandstorm, the skies are covered with clouds, and sand blows with full force everywhere.

There are countless rivers that form outside of the Sahara but then enter the Sahara through waterways under the ground. In the southern Sahara, the majority of the water orginates from the Nile River and the other rivers that to into the Mediterranean. Other rivers flow into Lake Chad, a freshwater lake, which also lies in the southern Sahara. In the north, the majority of the water flows from the Atlas Mountains and highlands of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia.

The climate of the Sahara is quite unique due to both dry and humid conditions in short to medium periods of time of its history. For the past 2, 000 years, the Saharan climate has remained more or less the same, except for a span of time in the 1500s and 1700s when the "Little Ice Age" took place in Europe. This ice age increased the precipitation over the desert until the 1800s.

The Sahara's climate is comprised of basically two sub-climates. In the north is a dry subtropical climate. This means cold winters, annually high temperature ranges, very hot summers, and two rainy seasons, with the majority of the rain falling in Auguest when flash floods send water to desert areas that usually don't get much rain. The southern part of the Sahara has a dry tropical clinate, with mild and dry winters, a hot dry season, adn a rainy season. Precipitation here is not just limited to rain, however. Snow can fall in higher elevations. The western part of this region is a bit cooler, thanks to the cold Canary Current.

One thing which is true of the sparse vegetation in the Sahara is that all the species are able to adapt to the unpredictable precipitation and high heat in the region. The plant life in the region includes trees, grasses, shrubs, and trees. In addition to plants, there are several animals, which include mammals, repitles, and birds, that live in the Sahara. These range from the desert hedgehog and anubis baboon among the mammals, to frogs and crocodiles, among the reptiles. Ostriches and barn owls are among the over 300 species of birds found in the Sahara.

The Sahara Desert covers more than 3.5 million square miles, yet it has only about 2 million inhabitants. This means about 1 person per square mile, making it one of the least densely populated areas in the world. Hardly surprising considering that the Sahara is one of the harshest environments in the world. However, thousands of years ago, the Sahara desert was more populated than it is today, due to a different climate than that of today. Archaeological findings of such items as fossils, stone artifacts, rock art, bone harpoons, shells, and aquatic animals suggest an abundance of water in the Sahara which made for much more habitable conditions.

Nomads, people who continuously move from place to place, make up the majority of the inhabitants of the Sahara Desert. It is believed that the first nomads arrived to this area 7,000 years ago with the arrival of domestic animals, likely brought to area by the Caspian culture of northern Africa. In addition to the nomads, other groups also lived in separate groups in the desert, but it is believed that the nomads were the ones who contributed to the development of trade among these groups and with other countries.

It may seem to be the definition of craziness to want to spend a year living in the desert, but it can also be wonderful for several reasons.
First, living in the desert is an unbelievably unique experience.
There is nowhere else where you can see such bare land, except for a few plants, but which at the same time is beautiful.
The plateaus are not green but they are wide and interesting just the same.
And, there is nothing more beautiful than to see camels, the real animal of the desert, walking around.
Second, the desert is a timeless place where nothing has really changed much in a long, long time.
For example, if you were here a thousand years ago, you would have seen nomads just as you see them today.
In addition to the nomads and camels, there are also caves which can be found in the higher areas of the desert.
From those high areas, you can call out and hear echoes over and over again.
That might be one of the only sounds you hear, especially since this is a true place to come to rest since there is nothing to bother you here.
For example, instead of checking email or talking on a cell phone, you actually spend your time swapping stories with other people.
Some people feel trapped because they feel that there is no way out, but I could stay here forever.
