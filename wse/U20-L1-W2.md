Hi, there Jim,
I'm a differnt man since I came to this place. When you see me again you won't believe how much I've changed.
It was damned hard at the start, I can tell you. No whiskey, no poker, no cigarettes, and nothing but salads to eat.
But I took it like a man. Soon I started to enjoy running and drinking carrot juice; now I can run 15 miles without stopping!
I feel like a new man already; Look out, girls, here comes the new, improved Martin Kasubian.
So how are you, my dear old friend? I can just see you now: sitting at your desk, worrying too much, and going to the bar after work to drink too much and somke too much.
Yes, you'll probably die before you're 40, but I'll just go on and on, drinking my carrot juice.
Best wishes, Martin.

You won't believe how much I weigh now!
I have already run 10 miles today.

You haven't done any exercise today.

The pain was from a heart attack.
Dr. Woodson works in the health clinic on 14th Avenue.

Tim is very healty and fit.
Eating fresh fruit and vegetables helps care for（有助于维护）your health.
