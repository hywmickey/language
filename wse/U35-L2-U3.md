I'll show you the product that we're marketing at the moment.
我将向您展示我们目前正在推广的产品。
It's a most attractive and useful little device which can be used both as a washing machine and as a coffee maker.
It's so small it can be kept in a cupboard when it's not being used.
“when it's not being used” 现在进行时被动语态，强调 “不被使用时” 的状态，被动语态突出物品被操作的关系。

How would you go about selling our products, if you were offered the position?
Imagine I'm at home wathing TV or eating dinner or whatever, and you come around and knock on my front door. 
What would you say to me?
Would you just leave me standing on the doorstep, or what?
你就打算让我一直站在门阶上不管，还是怎样？
I'd try to sell you something.

What were your reasons for applying for this job?
what was it that particularly interested you?
Was it the prodcut, perhaps, or had you already heard__ of the Double Cross organization?
What was it that made you pick up your pen and write to us?
I'm sorry, sir. I wrote the application with a pencil.

Sorry, my mind went blank.
It could have happened to anyone.
I thought you were asking me if I wanted something to eat.
I should have listened more carefully.

I was doing very well when I left.
I thought it was time to change jobs; time to move into a different field.
You said in your letter that you were dismissed.
你在信中说，你被解雇了。
What were you dismissed for?

I see that you worked for Plastic Box for a while.
What was your position there, exactly?
Well, to be absolutely exact___.
I was Junior Assistant Deputy Marketing Manager.
But I could have become Marketing Manager in a few years.
Since then you suttenly have ___ experiences
You've been unemployed quite a bit, and you've even been in the music business.
I wonder what actual sales experience you've had?
Well, I have sold gas, in a gas station.

You don't have to be super-salesman of the year to sell gas to a guy with an empty tank.
你不必成为年度最佳推销员，也能把汽油卖给一个油箱空的人。
So what about your qualifications, then?
Have you got any qualifications in sales or marketing?
Have you done any tranning courses, or anything like that.
Oh yes, I've attended a Dynathought seminar.
You must have found it terribly useful.
你一定发现它非常有用。

Our salesmen don't receive any salary or wages, but they earn an excellent commission on what they sell.
commission: 佣金
We pay 5% on first 2000 dollars' worth of goods sold, and 10% after that, so you income depends on your success as a salesman.
No sales, no earnings. Is that clear?

It can be used as a washing machine.
You can use it as a coffee maker too.
However, we can't use it as a refrigerator.
This product can't be found in stores. It's only sold door-to-door.
It's a great prodcut. It can't be beat.
这是一个很棒的产品。它无法被击败。

My mind went blank during the interview. It could have happened to anyone.
It sounds interesting. You must have found the seminar very useful.
If I had stayed with the company, I could have become Marketing Manager.
Working at a gas station was easy. Anyone could have done it.
He was fired. He must have done something wrong.
I should have filled out the application in pen, not pencil. I'm sorry.
John look happy. He must have gotten the job.

It's easy to sell gas to a guy with an empty tank.
Then we pay 10% after that.

He said he wanted to move into a different field.
My boss told me I was doing very well when I left.
She said I needed to submit a written application.

What qualifications do you have for this job? For example, do you have any experience or training?
She was a sales clerk for an electronics store.
You should submit an application for that job if it interests you.
She earns a great salary at her job.
Another applicant got the job.
His earnings depend on how much he sells.
John has attended a special tranning seminar.
When did you submit the application?
Do you have any sales experience?
He works at a nice restaurant, but he doesn't get good wages.
She was dismissed from her last job.
Salemen at his company earn a 10% commission.
