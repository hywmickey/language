About ten minutes ago, just before you came in.
Do you know where he went.
To the airport, I think.
How did he go to the airport?
Did he take the car, or did he go by subway?

Will you please let me pass?

Where did he go?
He said something about Trinidad.
I didn't know what's there!

Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?

Let me take your coat.
I got you some wine.
Dinner will be ready soon.
Are you warm enough?
Shall I turn on the heater?
No, I'm fine, really, thanks.
I'll pour some wine, then.
Oh dear, my glass is empty!

You mustn't come near me!
People eat worse things than this.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that!


I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Please tell me what you said.
Where is Miyako? Please tell me where she went.
He didn't tell me what happened.
I didn't get what I wanted.
Were you late? Tell me when you came.
What happened to Jorge? I must know what he did!
I have to find my wife. You must tell me where she went.
I must know why you married me. Was it for my money?

Roger isn't with Susan. He went away.
Susan got what she wanted, didn't she?
Harry needs to know where Roger went.

Some drugs were in Roger's suitcases.

Is this Baoling's first time playing golf? no.
How does Baoling play at first? not very well.
What does Mr. Landis want? to order more shirts and dresses.

Good moring, madam. Can I help you?
Yes, I booked a golf lesson.
The fee_ for the lesson is $150, plus $80 to rent clubs, plus $125 service charge__, that's $355 in all.
Are you paying by card?
No, by cash.

Let's go and choose some clubs.
You have to hold the club like this, and move it like this, OK?
Keep going.
You have to hold higher than that.
Let me show you.
This is the best way to learn.
So, you take the club up like this, then you bring it down like this.
Now let's see you get it into the hole.

Mr. Landis, the owner of the store, would like to meet you.
He's interested in ordering a much large number, maybe a thousand dresses and five hundred shirts.

So, Have you played golf before?
Oh, yes, many times.
It's so long since I last play.
Don't worry about it.
You came here for a lesson, right?


Please choose some clubs.
Can you hold the club like this?
Here, let me show you.
That was good. Keep going.
OK, this is a good way to learn.
See? Hold the club high, like this.
Now move it like this.
You got it into the hole! Great!

This dress is expensive. I need to find a cheaper one.
Your club is very low. Hold it higher.
Our teacher is good. But the teacher we had before was better!
I'm cold. I'd like to be a little warmer.
That cake is so large! I want a smaller one.
I like the subway, but let's get a cab. It's quicker.
Put some sugar in your tea. It'll be sweater.
That's a small salad. Could you please have a bigger one?
You're very short. I asked for a taller man.

I don't usually talk so much.
He often plays much better than that.
She's not always so unhappy.
Mark never cook like this!
You're not usually so late to class. 
My friends don't usually listen to rock music.
Oh, I usually dance better than this.
I don't often eat in restaurants.
We never travel by bus.
Do you often by new programs?

She's very pretty. She's more beautifu than I am.
It's going to be warm day. I think it will be hotter than yesterday.
A: Is he a gentle man? B: Oh, yes. He's nicer than my toher boyfriend.
A: This isn't a good hotel. B: That's true. But, the other hotel was worse than this one!
I don't make clothes for young women. I make clothes for more mature women.
I often go out alone. I'm more independent than my friends.
Let's go to the Chinese restaurant. It's nearer to the office than the Italian restaurant.
I need to find a better school. This school isn't very good.
Are you lonely? I think I'm more alone than you are.
