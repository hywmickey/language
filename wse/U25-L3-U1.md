The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority(WMATA) operators the second largest rail transit system and the fifty largest bus network in the United States. Safe, clean and reliable, "America's Transit System" Transports more than a third of the federal goverment t work and millions of tourists to the landmarks in the Nation's Capital.
Background
The Authority was created in 1967 by an Interstate Compact to plan, develop, biuld, finance and operate a balanced regional transportation system in the National Capital area. Construction of the Metrorail system began in 1969. Four area bus systems were acquired in 1973. The first phase of metrorail began operation in 1976. The final leg of the original 103-mile rail networks was completed in early 2001. Today, there are 86 Metro stations in service within a 106.3 mile network. These are divided into five lines: Blue, Green, Orange, Red and Yellow.
Service area
Metrorial and Metrobus serve a population of 3.5 million within a 1,500 square-mile area. The transit zone consists of the Distric of Columbia, the suburban Mayland countries of Montgomeryand Prince George's and the Northern Virginia counties of Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun and the the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax and Falls Church. Overall, 42 percent of those working in the center core-Washington and parts of Arlington Country-use mass transit.
Revenue
Metro and the federal government are partners in transportation. Thirty-five metrorial stations serve federal facilities and nearly half of Metro's peak period commutes are federal employees. Since WMATA's inception, the federal government has contributed 65 percent of the capital costs. Fares and other revenue fund 57.6 percent of the daily operations while state and local governments fund the remaining 42.4 percent. Metro increased fares in FY04 and FY05.
Ridership
In 2006, 337 million riders rode the subway and rail combined 206 million of these went by rail; the remaining 131 million took the bus.
Metroail Communication and security
Metrorail takes its security and communications seriously. Digital signs in the stations show the next train arrival times, system status and time of day, and two-way radios facilitate communication between train operators and the operations control center. There are also hotlines from operations control center to police and fire departments. Fire extinguishers can be found on platforms and inside rail cars, and there is an automated electronic fire protection system in stations and tunnels. Additonally, call boxes are spaced every 800 feet(244 meters) along the tracks.

Interestingly, the longest escalator in the Wetern Hemisphere 508 feet is located in Wheaton station. The deepest station is Forest Glen at 21 stores or 196 feet.

I think good public transportation system needs to be cealn and run on time and be affoordabel so everyone can use it.

We've been ranked number one in customer service for the last five years.
That's because we're clean, we're reliable, and we're very safe.
Have you seen an increase of ridership?
Last year, we averaged about serven hundred thousand riders a day.
And we've seen it increase up to seven hundred and fifty thousand on average.
