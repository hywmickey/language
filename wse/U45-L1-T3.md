KEEP US APPART Recorded by Toni Moroni
There's a sad little girl who just stares at the window, Waiting to see if her Dad will come home. Trying to hold back her tears as she cries to her mother: "Oh Momma won't you tell me, where has Daddy gone?"
I wish I could tell you, my sweet little daughter. To tell you the truth would just break your little heart. So I'll tell you your Dad's working late at the office, A desk is what keeps us apart.
Meanwhile he is lying in the arms of a lady, laughing and joking as he drinks her red wine. And he tells her he loves her and he'll always stay with her. And she can't help falling for that same old line.
With never a thought for his sweet little daughter, who cries for her Dad from the bottom of her heart. He says "They won't find out I know what they're thinking - A desk is what keeps us apart."
Back home now his daughter has grown a bit older. She's given up waiting for Dad to come home. And she looks at her Mom and says "Tell me what happened? My Dad's never here, we might as well be alone."
It's hard to face up to the facts but I'll try, I'll tell you the truth now, though it might break your heart. Your Daddy has found a new L-A-D-Y; A desk ain't what keeps us apart.

《隔岸相望》（KEEP US APART）
演唱：托尼·莫罗尼（Toni Moroni）

有个可怜的小女孩，正凝望窗外  
盼着爸爸能回家来  
她强忍着泪水，对妈妈哭诉：  
“妈妈呀，你能不能告诉我，爸爸到底去了哪里？”  

我多希望能告诉你，我亲爱的乖女儿  
可若说出真相，只会伤透你的心  
所以我只能说，爸爸在办公室加班  
是一张办公桌，将我们隔在两端  

与此同时，他正依偎在另一个女人怀里  
边喝着她的红酒，边与她嬉笑打闹  
他对她说着“我爱你”，说会永远陪在她身边  
而她，还是忍不住对这套老说辞心动  

却从没想过他亲爱的乖女儿  
正发自内心地盼着爸爸回家  
他暗自想着：“他们不会发现的，我知道他们在想什么——  
是一张办公桌，将我们隔在两端。”  

如今回到家里，女儿已长大了一些  
她不再等爸爸回家了  
她看着妈妈，问道：“告诉我到底怎么了？  
爸爸从来不在家，我们跟没有爸爸也没两样。”  

面对真相很难，但我会努力说出口  
现在我就告诉你真相，即便它可能伤透你的心  
你爸爸有了新的爱人（L-A-D-Y）  
一张办公桌，根本不是将我们分隔的理由

翻译说明（贴合歌词情感与语境）：
1. **标题处理**："KEEP US APART" 直译为“将我们分开”，但结合歌词中“爸爸用‘办公桌’当借口隐瞒真相”的核心矛盾，译为“隔岸相望”更添情感张力——既体现物理上的分离，也暗含“家人被谎言隔开”的无奈，贴合歌曲悲伤基调。  
2. **口语化与情感传递**：  
   - 妈妈对女儿的称呼“my sweet little daughter”译为“我亲爱的乖女儿”，符合中文家长对孩子的亲昵语气；  
   - 女儿的疑问“we might as well be alone”未直译“我们不如孤单”，而是译为“我们跟没有爸爸也没两样”，更贴近孩子直白的委屈感；  
3. **关键意象保留**：“A desk is what keeps us apart”中“desk”是爸爸的谎言核心，前几次译为“是一张办公桌，将我们隔在两端”，最后妈妈戳破真相时改为“一张办公桌，根本不是将我们分隔的理由”，通过“根本不是”强化“谎言被揭穿”的转折，呼应歌词情绪变化；  
4. **细节优化**：“falling for that same old line”中的“line”指“花言巧语”，译为“老说辞”比“老台词”更贴近日常语境，体现女人明知是谎言却仍心动的状态。

Mom said that you're to help me wash the dishes. 
妈妈说，你要帮我洗碗。
be to do sth: 不是简单的 “将要做”，而是有明确的 “按安排、要求或命令要做的事” 的意思，比 “will do”（将要做）或 “have to do”（必须做）更强调 “有明确的指令 / 约定”。
It's really not worth mentioning. Just forget it.
这真的不值得一提。忘了吧。
He spoke to me as if I were idiot.
We are not allowed to go there under any circumstances.
I think that it is ridiculous that we should be mean to each other.
be mean to sb: 就是 “对某人刻薄 / 态度不好”
我觉得我们竟然要彼此刻薄，这太荒唐了。
He blames me for causing the accident, but I had nothing to do with it.
他怪我造成了这场事故，可我跟这事一点关系都没有。
blame sb for doing sth：因做某事而责怪某人
This meat tastes like chicken.
I thought you might want to talk to me since you looked so sad last night.
我想你可能想和我谈谈，因为你昨晚看起来很难过。
I have already told you that you're to go there immediately. Please don't ask me again.
我已经告诉过你，你要马上去那里。请不要再问我了。
There's no need to complain. I'll take care of the problem right away.
没必要抱怨。我马上处理这个问题。
You shouldn't be eating this junk food. It's so unhealthy.
你不该吃这种垃圾食品，它太不健康了。
    “shouldn't be + 动词 - ing” 这种说法，比直接说 “shouldn't eat”（不该吃）更侧重 **“当下的行为不合适” 或 “最近经常做的事不好”**，不是 “永远不能吃”，而是 “现在 / 当前不该吃”，语气更委婉、带有关心，不是强硬禁止。
    朋友边吃冰淇淋边说 “最近胃不舒服”，你可以劝：“You shouldn't be eating cold ice cream right now. Your stomach will hurt more.”（你现在不该吃冷冰淇淋，胃会更疼的。）
    妈妈看到孩子睡前吃薯片：“You shouldn't be eating chips before bed. They’re hard to digest.”（你睡前不该吃薯片，不好消化。）

John Dean has changed his style of songs. He has now gone rock and roll.
约翰・迪恩（John Dean）改变了他的歌曲风格，如今他转向了摇滚乐（rock and roll）。
    gone：转向、开始从事（某种风格 / 领域），强调 “从之前的状态转变为新的风格 / 类型”，是描述 “风格、兴趣变化” 的常用口语表达。
    朋友以前爱画画，现在开始玩摄影：She used to paint, but now she’s gone photography.（她以前画画，现在转向摄影了。）
    弟弟以前听民谣，现在喜欢嘻哈：My brother used to listen to folk music, but now he’s gone hip-hop.（我弟弟以前听民谣，现在转向嘻哈了。）
This unexpected change of style has made him very popular.
这种意想不到的风格变化使他非常受欢迎。
His current song is playing all across Europe where he has become extremely popular.
他目前的歌曲在欧洲各地播放，在那里他变得非常受欢迎。
The style of his music is really soft and romantic.
soft: 轻柔的、舒缓的
Let's listen to the monster hit by the newest American band.
咱们来听听美国最新乐队的那首爆红热门曲吧。
monster hit： “hit” 在音乐 / 娱乐领域指 “热门作品（如歌曲、电影）”，“monster” 在这里不是 “怪物”，而是强调 “超级、爆红的、极具影响力的”，合起来就是 “爆红热门曲”“超级爆款歌”，特指 “人气极高、传播度很广的歌曲”。
	“That song is a monster hit this year.”（那首歌是今年的爆红热门曲。）
You don't really expect me to fall for that old line, do you? It sounds like something from a song.
你不会真以为我会信那种老套说辞吧？这听起来就像歌里的词儿。
    “fall for”： “相信（尤指骗人的话）、上当”，比如 “fall for a lie”（信了谎言）；
    “old line”： “老套的说辞、陈词滥调”（比如重复过很多次、一听就不真实的话，像客套话、敷衍的借口、老套的情话等）。
    朋友总用 “下次请你吃饭” 敷衍你，你可以说：“Don’t think I’ll fall for that old line—you never keep your word!”（别以为我会信你那老套说辞，你从来不算数！）
    反义疑问句：You don't really expect me to..., do you?
    含义：“你不会真指望 / 以为我会…… 吧？”，用 “don’t really” 和 “do you?” 加强 “不相信对方” 的语气，暗示 “你说的话太假，我不可能信”，不是真的提问，而是表达态度。
    生活例子：对方让你帮他做所有事，还说 “你最热心了”，你可以说：“You don’t really expect me to do everything for you, do you?”（你不会真以为我会帮你做所有事吧？）
I have a great idea for a song. Listen to these words: When are you going to face up to the facts?
我想到了一个写歌的好点子，你听听这些歌词：“你到底打算什么时候正视事实？”
He has got a voice that you just have to listen to.
他的嗓音特别让人忍不住想听。
has got a voice: 字面是 “拥有一副嗓音”，日常交流中可简化为 “他的嗓音”，不强调 “拥有” 这个动作，重点在 “嗓音本身的特点”。
“just have to”： “忍不住要、不由自主想”，强调嗓音有极强的吸引力，让人听到就不想停下，是一种 “被吸引后的自然反应”。
   just 是 副词，核心含义是 “就是、实在是”，作用是加强语气，突出 “你‘忍不住要听、必然会想听’他声音” 的自然感和必然性。
	评价播音员、配音演员时也能用，比如 “Her voice is so warm that you just have to listen to”（她的嗓音特别温柔，让人忍不住想听）。
He has had three songs and all of them have become a hit within just minutes of being heard.
他推出了三首歌曲，每一首一经播放，短短几分钟内就成了热门曲目。
“within minutes” 是 “短短几分钟内”，“being heard” 不是 “被听见”，而是 “（歌曲）被播放、被听众听到”（即 “发布 / 上线后”）；
	The video got 10,000 likes within just minutes of being posted.（这段视频一经发布，短短几分钟内就获得了 1 万个赞。）
We are now in the home of rock and roll. While were are here, we need to really find some good places.
我们现在正身处摇滚乐的发源地（或 “摇滚乐圣地”）。既然来了这儿（趁我们在这儿），咱们得好好找找些好地方（比如经典的摇滚场地、酒吧之类的）。
“really” 在这里不是 “真的”，而是强调 “好好地、认真地找”；

I’m sort of busy right now.（我这会儿算是有点忙。）

纠错：You looked as if you were sort of needed my help, and I wanted to be nice.



正确句子应为：**You looked as if you were sort of needing my help, and I wanted to be nice.**  

错误原因解析（用简单的话讲清楚）：
原句里的“were sort of needed”错在“需要”的语态用反了——  
“needed”在这里是“被需要”的意思（比如“help is needed”是“需要帮助”），但句子想表达的是“你（主动）需要我的帮助”，不是“你被需要帮助”，所以要把被动的“needed”改成主动的“needing”，和前面的“were”搭配，符合“looked as if（看起来好像）”后面描述“当时正在发生的状态”的感觉。  

而“sort of”（有点儿、大概）的用法是对的，放在“were”和“needing”之间，刚好修饰“需要”的程度，让语气更自然，符合日常说话的随意感。  


补充：更简洁的口语表达
日常聊天时，还可以把“were sort of needing”简化成“sort of needed”（去掉“were”），句子会更流畅，意思不变：  
**You looked as if you sort of needed my help, and I wanted to be nice.**  
（原因：“looked as if”后面接“一般过去时”也能表达“过去的状态”，口语里这样说更省事，比如“他看起来好像累了”可以说“He looked as if he was tired”或“He looked as if he tired”，后者更口语化）  

例句语境（帮你理解怎么用）：
比如你帮了别人，对方问你“为什么突然帮我呀？”，你就可以说：  

- A: Thanks for helping me carry the bags—why did you stop to help?  
  （A：谢谢你帮我拎包，你怎么会停下来帮忙呀？）  
- B: Oh, no big deal. You looked as if you were sort of needing my help, and I wanted to be nice.  
  （B：哦，没什么。我看你好像有点儿需要帮忙，就想着顺手帮个忙呗。）

---

解析：Mom said that you're to help me wash the dishes.

一、句子核心意思  
妈妈说，你要帮我洗碗。  


二、句子结构拆解（简单易懂版）  
这句话是“妈妈说的内容”+“具体要做的事”，可以拆成两部分看：  
1. **主句（谁做了什么）**：Mom said（妈妈说了）  
   - 这里的“that”是个“连接词”，作用是引出妈妈具体说的话，日常口语里可以省略，比如直接说“Mom said you're to help me wash the dishes”，意思完全一样。  
2. **从句（妈妈说的具体内容）**：you're to help me wash the dishes（你要帮我洗碗）  
   - 核心动作是“help me wash the dishes”（帮我洗碗），前面的“you're to”是关键，决定了“帮洗碗”不是随便的想法，而是“按妈妈的要求要做的事”。  


三、重点语法：“be to do sth”（核心！）  
这句话里最关键的是“you're to help...”中的“be to do sth”结构，它不是简单的“将要做”，而是有明确的“**按安排、要求或命令要做的事**”的意思，比“will do”（将要做）或“have to do”（必须做）更强调“有明确的指令/约定”。  

1. 用通俗的话解释：  
“be to do sth”就像“有人跟你说好了/安排好了，你得做这件事”，比如妈妈安排你洗碗、老师要求你交作业、公司规定你加班，都可以用这个结构。  

2. 举生活中的例子（一看就懂）：  
- 老师安排作业：The teacher said we **are to hand in** the homework tomorrow.（老师说我们明天要交作业。）  
- 爸爸安排家务：Dad said my brother **is to take out** the trash.（爸爸说我弟弟要去倒垃圾。）  
- 规则要求：All students **are to be** in class before 8 a.m.（所有学生要在早上8点前到教室。）  


四、句子语气&场景  
这句话里的“be to do”（you're to...）暗含了“**这是妈妈的要求，需要照做**”的语气，不是“商量着来”的感觉。比如：  
- 如果是朋友随便提议“要不要帮我洗碗”，会说“Will you help me wash the dishes？”；  
- 但用“you're to help...”，就明确是“妈妈已经安排好了，你得帮我”，有“指令感”。  

日常家人之间安排家务、学校/工作里传达要求时，都常用这个结构，清晰又不生硬。

翻译：I am glad that you lost all that money. You deserved to after how you used to treat those less fortunate than you.

核心翻译  
你把那些钱全亏光（或“弄丢”），我可太高兴了。你以前那样对待不如你幸运的人，现在这都是你活该。  


关键表达解析（重点抓语气和情感，附例子）  
这句话带着强烈的“幸灾乐祸+指责”语气，核心是“对方的损失是应得的”，拆解关键部分帮你理解这种情绪：  

. I am glad that you lost all that money  
- “glad”此处不是普通的“开心”，而是**“幸灾乐祸的高兴”**，暗指“你损失钱，我觉得解气”；  
- “lost all that money”：“lost”可根据语境理解为“弄丢”（比如丢了现金）或“亏光”（比如投资、赌博亏损），翻译时两种意思都适用，保留“全亏光/弄丢”能体现“损失惨重”，强化语气；  
- 例子：看到自私的人吃亏，有人会说“I’m glad he got what he wanted—nothing!”（他一无所获，我可太高兴了），和原句“幸灾乐祸”的感觉一致。  

2. You deserved to (lose all that money)  
- “deserved to”是核心，字面是“值得”，实际是**“活该、罪有应得”**，后面省略了“lose all that money”，翻译时补全“这都是你活该”更符合中文口语习惯，直接表达“你受损失是应得的”；  
- 例子：有人故意破坏规则还吃亏，就可以说“He cheated in the game and lost—he deserved to!”（他比赛作弊还输了，这都是他活该！）。  

3. less fortunate than you  
- 含义：“fortunate”是“幸运的、处境好的”，“less fortunate”就是“不如你幸运的、处境比你差的人”（比如经济条件不好、生活遇到困难的人），比直译“比你不幸的人”更自然；  
- 例子：形容帮助弱势人群，可说“We should help those less fortunate than us”（我们应该帮助那些处境比我们差的人）。  


语气与场景说明  
这句话明显是**带有报复性的指责**，通常出现在“说话人长期看不惯对方的自私行为（欺负/忽视处境差的人），看到对方遭遇损失后，忍不住表达解气和指责”的场景，比如：  
- 某人心眼坏，常看不起穷人，后来自己投资亏了大钱，你就可能说这句话，既表达“你活该”的态度，又点出“活该”的原因（以前对弱势人群不好）。  
整体语气尖锐直接，没有委婉，完全是“情绪外放的指责”，翻译时要保留这种“不掩饰的幸灾乐祸和批判”。

要区分“deserved to”和“be worthy of”，关键看**核心逻辑（因果vs价值）、用法结构、语气场景**，用大白话+生活例子拆解，一看就懂：

一、核心逻辑：“因果对应” vs “价值匹配”
这是两者最本质的区别，先记住一句话：  

- **deserved to**：因为“之前做了某件事”，所以“应得某个结果”（不管结果是好是坏，都和“过去的行为”直接挂钩）；  
- **be worthy of**：因为“本身有价值/有资格”，所以“值得某个东西/待遇”（和“过去的行为”不直接绑定，更看“自身具备的条件”）。  


二、用法结构：接什么？怎么用？
| 短语          | 后面接什么？                | 简单公式                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **deserved to** | 只能接“动词原形”            | 主语 + deserved to + 动词 |
| **be worthy of** | 接“名词”或“动词-ing形式”    | 主语 + be worthy of + 名词/动词-ing |


三、场景+例子：对比着学更清晰
1. 描述“好结果”：努力后的“应得” vs 能力上的“配得”
- **用deserved to**（强调“因为努力，所以应得”，有因果）：  
  She practiced the piano 4 hours a day, so she **deserved to win** the competition.  
  （她每天练4小时钢琴，所以赢得比赛是她应得的。）  
  → 逻辑：“每天练4小时”（过去行为）→ “赢比赛”（应得的结果）。

- **用be worthy of**（强调“有能力，配得上”，看自身价值）：  
  Her piano skills are so excellent that she **is worthy of the prize**.  
  （她的钢琴技巧太棒了，完全配得上这个奖项。）  
  → 逻辑：“技巧棒”（自身能力）→ “配得上奖项”（价值匹配），不刻意提“过去练了多久”。


2. 描述“坏结果”：做错事后的“活该” vs （几乎不用坏结果）
- **deserved to** 可以用于“坏结果”（强调“做错事→该受惩罚”，带情绪）：  
  He lied to his parents many times—he **deserved to be scolded**.  
  （他骗了父母好多次，被骂是他活该。）  
  → 能表达“活该”的负面情绪，这是“be worthy of”做不到的。

- **be worthy of** 几乎不用于“坏结果”（因为它侧重“正面价值/资格”，不用于“该受惩罚”）：  
  不能说“He is worthy of being scolded”（错句），听起来很奇怪——“值得被骂”不符合“be worthy of”的“价值匹配”逻辑。


3. 正式vs口语：语气差异
- **deserved to**：更口语化、直接，日常聊天常用，可带情绪（比如“活该”的不满、“应得”的认可）；  
  例：（朋友考了好成绩）You studied so hard—you totally deserved to get an A!（你学得这么努力，拿A完全是应得的！）

- **be worthy of**：更正式、客观，适合书面语（如报告、评价）或严肃场景，不带强烈情绪，只说“资格/价值”；  
  例：（评价一位学者）His research has made great contributions to the field, so he is worthy of the honor.（他的研究对该领域贡献巨大，所以配得上这份荣誉。）


四、一句话总结：怎么选？
- 想表达“**因为做了某件事，所以应得某个结果**”（不管好坏，有因果）→ 用 **deserved to + 动词**；  
- 想表达“**本身有价值/有资格，值得某个东西**”（不强调过去行为，看自身条件）→ 用 **be worthy of + 名词/动词-ing**。

总结：“动词 + through”的核心共性

“within just minutes of”可以用哪些短语替换？

“within just minutes of” 的核心功能是表达“**某事件发生后短短几分钟内**”，且隐含“时间极短、动作紧跟事件”的强调意味。替换时需保留这两个核心要素，同时可根据语境（口语/书面、强调程度）选择不同短语，以下是分场景的高频替换方案，附用法解析和例句对比：


一、保留“强调时间短”（呼应原短语中“just”的作用）
这类替换短语通过 “mere（仅仅的）”“only（只）” 等词，延续原短语对“时间极短”的强调，适合需要突出“快速衔接”的场景。

| 替换短语                | 核心含义                | 用法解析                                  | 例句对比（原句：Within just minutes of the café opening, seats were taken.） |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **within mere minutes of** | 在……的仅仅几分钟内      | “mere” 比 “just” 更书面化，强调“时间少到意外” | Within mere minutes of the café opening, seats were taken.                  |
| **within only minutes of** | 在……的只几分钟内        | “only” 口语化，直接强调“不超过几分钟”      | Within only minutes of the café opening, seats were taken.                  |
| **in just a few minutes of** | 在……的短短几分钟内      | “a few” 补充“数量少”，更口语化            | In just a few minutes of the café opening, seats were taken.                |


二、弱化“just”的强调，侧重“时间范围”
若无需刻意突出“短”，仅需表达“事件后几分钟内”，可去掉强调词，用更简洁的短语，适合日常对话或无需过度强调的场景。

| 替换短语                | 核心含义                | 用法解析                                  | 例句对比                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **within minutes of**    | 在……的几分钟内          | 去掉“just”，保留“短时间”核心，最简洁      | Within minutes of the café opening, seats were taken.（仍隐含“短”，但不强调） |
| **in minutes of**        | 在……的几分钟内          | “in” 替代 “within”，口语中更自然          | In minutes of the café opening, seats were taken.                            |


三、更书面化/正式的替换（适合报告、文章等）
这类短语更严谨，通过 “a matter of（大约、左右）”“following（在……之后）” 提升正式感，同时保留“短时间”含义。

| 替换短语                          | 核心含义                | 用法解析                                  | 例句对比                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **within a matter of minutes after** | 在……之后的短短几分钟内  | “a matter of minutes” 表“大约几分钟”，正式且自然 | Within a matter of minutes after the café opened, seats were taken.          |
| **within minutes following**      | 在……之后的几分钟内      | “following” 替代 “of”，更书面，接名词      | Within minutes following the café’s opening, seats were taken.               |
| **in the space of just minutes after** | 在……之后的短短几分钟里  | “the space of” 表“时间段”，正式且强调“时间跨度短” | In the space of just minutes after the café opened, seats were taken.        |


四、口语化简化替换（适合日常对话、非正式场景）
这类短语更简洁，省略部分结构，但仍能清晰传递“短时间内”的含义，适合聊天、日常描述。

| 替换短语                | 核心含义                | 用法解析                                  | 例句对比                                                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **just minutes after**   | 在……之后短短几分钟      | 省略“within”，直接用“just minutes after”，口语常用 | Just minutes after the café opened, seats were taken.                       |
| **a couple of minutes after** | 在……之后一两分钟内      | “a couple of” 表“两三分钟”，模糊但自然，适合非正式场景 | A couple of minutes after the café opened, seats were taken.                |


总结：替换短语选择指南
| 场景需求                | 推荐替换短语                          | 特点                                  |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 强调“时间极短”          | within mere minutes of / just minutes after | 突出“短到意外”，口语/书面均可         |
| 简洁自然（无强强调）    | within minutes of / in minutes of     | 通用，适合多数日常/书面场景           |
| 正式书面（报告/文章）   | within a matter of minutes after / within minutes following | 严谨，提升正式感                     |
| 口语化（聊天/日常）     | a couple of minutes after / just minutes after | 简洁，不纠结细节，自然流畅           |

关键原则：无论选择哪个短语，需确保 **“事件”与“后续动作”的时间衔接关系不变**（即“事件在前，动作在后，间隔几分钟内”），同时根据语境的正式程度和是否需要强调“短”来匹配短语即可。
