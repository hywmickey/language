伴随状语的核心作用，就是用一个短语来描述“主句动作发生时，同时存在的另一个动作或状态”，让句子信息更丰富、逻辑更连贯。

一、核心定义与作用
伴随状语本身不是独立句子，而是依附于主句的补充成分。它主要用来回答两个问题：

1. 主句动作发生时，**主语同时在做什么**（伴随动作）。比如“He sat there reading a book”，“reading a book”就是伴随状语，说明“他坐着”的同时“在看书”。
2. 主句动作发生时，**主语处于什么状态**（伴随状态）。比如“She ran out of the room crying”，“crying”是伴随状语，说明“她跑出去”时“在哭”的状态。

二、常见表现形式
日常使用中，伴随状语最常见的有3种形式，其中“现在分词/过去分词”是高频考点：
1. **现在分词（doing）**：当伴随动作与主句动作是“同一个主语主动发出”时使用。
   - 例：They walked along the street **singing happily**（他们沿街走，同时开心地唱歌）。
2. **过去分词（done）**：当伴随状态是“主语被动承受”时使用。
   - 例：The letter came **written in English**（信寄来了，信上是用英文写的）。
3. **介词短语**：用“with/without+名词”的结构，描述伴随的物品或状态。
   - 例：He left the office **with a smile**（他笑着离开了办公室）。

三、关键使用要点
1. 逻辑主语一致：伴随状语的逻辑主语，必须和主句的主语是同一个，否则句子会有歧义。比如“Standing by the window, she watched the rain”，“Standing”的主语就是主句的“she”，逻辑一致。
2. 与主句动作同时性：伴随状语描述的动作/状态，必须和主句动作“同时发生”，不能有明显的先后顺序。

解释一下：We're going to have to move fast.

这句话语法正确、表达自然，核心是“我们必须得快点行动”，传递出一种“时间紧迫、需要立刻加快节奏”的紧迫感，常用于计划或执行任务的场景。

1. 核心含义与使用场景
句子通过“be going to + have to”的结构，强调“客观情况或当下需求迫使我们必须提速”，而非主观意愿，常见场景包括：
- 赶时间时，比如“离火车发车只剩10分钟了，我们得快点行动”。
- 应对紧急情况时，比如“暴雨马上要来了，我们得赶紧把户外的东西搬进来”。
- 推进任务时，比如“项目截止日期快到了，我们必须加快进度”。

2. 关键结构解析
句子的核心是“be going to have to do sth.”，这个结构专门用于表达“未来需要被迫做某事”，比单纯的“have to”更强调“即将到来的必要性”：
- **be going to**：表“计划或即将发生的动作”，说明“加快行动”是接下来要做的事。
- **have to**：表“客观需要、不得不”，强化“必须提速”的必要性，而非可选的选择。
- 谓语动词“move fast”：字面是“快速移动”，此处结合语境泛指“快速行动、加快进度”，是口语中常用的简洁表达。

3. 语气特点
这句话整体语气偏严肃、直接，没有委婉感，适合在需要统一节奏、推动行动的场合使用，能让对方清晰感受到“时间不等人，必须立刻行动”的信号。
