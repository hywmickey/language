Who does John call? Vlive.
Why does John have problems with the phone? It only takes credit cards.
Who is Clive? John's brother.
Where is John? in New York
John's new job is working with a band.
How much will Clive apy? 100
What time should John at the club? 7:30
What day will John see Clive? on Friday.

Cive, can you hear me?
I'm hanging up!
I guess there must be something wrong with this phone.
I'll have to call the operator.

And what number are you trying to call?
Syracuse 555 8056
The area code for Syracuse is 225.
So what difficulty have you had, caller?
I got through to my brother, but he couldn't hear me.

That's kind of problem at the moment.
The phone you're using doesn't take coins.
You'll have to use a credit card.
I'm over the limit.
Then you'd better make collect call.
collect: (打电话、电报等时)以由受话人(或收报人等)付费的方式
Hold the line, please, caller.
I have a collect call from New York for you.
What? Who from?
The name he gave was John.
Will you accept the call?
No way!
Are you still there, caller!
I didn't put you through.
He didn't accept the call.

I had a quarter when I called you, but I didn't have a credit card I could use, and anyway I don't think this phone works properly, so I called the operator.
quarter: 25分硬币
You needn't give a long explanation.

But tell me about this group: What are they called?
What kind of music do they play?
I don't exactly know. Buy they're really good.
What instruments do they play? Piano, guitar, drums, what?
Can't you tell me anything about them at all?
One of them said she thought Tony Moroni was fantastic!
So they're a sort of Tony Moroni style group, are they?

How's the plastic box business?
Oh, I've moved out of plastic boxes.
I'm in the entertainment business now.
You see, I'm managing this pop group, and I thought they could maybe play at your club.
I'm just the entertainment secretary.
But you do have music and dancing evengings, don't you?

I mean, do you really know these guys?
Oh yes, they asked me to manage them.
I just been to this amazing seminar, and then when I went out， I saw this advertisement in a record store.
How much do they charge for, say, 2 hours, with a 15-minute break in the middle?
charge: 收钱
I haven't realy thought about that.
It had better not be too much.
after all, they're completely unknown.
The evening starts at 8:30, but you'd better be there by 7:30.
Well, I'll book them for Firday night, then.
So, I'll look forward to seeing you on Friday.


I'd just been to this amazing seminar, and then when I went out, I saw this advertisement in a record store.
I hadn't really thought about how much to charge before you asked.
I'd already put int my last quater when I talked to the operator.
Clive wanted to know the pop group's name, but John had forgotten.
Before he became the group's manager, John had worked at a box company.
The operator hadn't told Clive it was his brother on the phone when he decided not to accept the call.

That's fine: good clean family entertainment.

I got through to my brother, but he couldn't hear me, so I guess this phone doesn't work.
That's kind of a problem at the moment. I'm over the limit.
Then you'd better make a collect call.

I wonder if you can help me.
the universe htoel Rome, Italy.
thanks, that's very kind of you.
What's the area code for Rome please?
how much does the call cost please?
Is that OK? No, not really, I only get a quarter.
I want to speak with Tony Moroni.
