Basically, they'll take over a lot of the everyday administrative stuff.
Does that mean I won't have to book flights and hotels anymore?
If you can just give me an idea of what you're looking for?
Hard working, intelligent, doesn't ask to many unnecessary questions.
That's great Nadia, but it's not really what we're looking for.
