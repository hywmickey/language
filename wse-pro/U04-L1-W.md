We're going to hire a junior assistant, right away.
Basically, they'll take over a lot of the everyday administrative stuff.
Does that mean I won't have to book flights and hotels anymore?
If you can just give me an idea of what you're looking for?
Hard working, intelligent, doesn't ask to many unnecessary questions.
That's great Nadia, but it's not really what we're looking for.
We're just looking for a marketing assistant to do administrative work.

My job title at World View Inc. was marketing and sales assistant.
One of my duties was to make travel arrangements for the senior managers.
Sometimes, I went on the trips to set up the meeting and conferences.
I kept records of all the new people we met.
Then, after every trip, I added the new names to our database.
I gave our website information to all the new people, too.
Traveling was a lot more interesting than ordering office supplies.
