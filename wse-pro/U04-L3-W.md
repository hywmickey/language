This slide shows the state of the market in 1991.
I did it as a pie chart. The red piece is us.
Well done. It looks very professional.
I can't find any market data before 1990.
It's not in the database.
They don't know anything about our products, and someone needs to brief them.

I'm trying to find out if we still make AlcoBerry anywhere in the world.
You know, the drink we make specially for bars and clubs ...
BerryAde plus alcohol.
We sell quite a lot of this product in Germany and Spain;
You couldn't show a poster like that here.
But you could still sell the product here.
What's the future of BerryAde?

# test
Our CEO asked if we are going to continue to make large cell phones.
We sell quite a lot of them to older people because large phones are easier to hold.
I am not sure how to find out how old our customers are.
Most young people use smaller phones, but I think we could still sell the bigger ones.
We could make them specially for the older market.
There might be a future selling them to young children, too.

I need to know our market share and the size of the market right from the start up to 1990.
right： 是副词，用来加强语气，无实际字面含义，可理解为 “从一开始就 / 自最初起 / 完完全全从……”，用来强调时间范围的起点是最开端、毫无遗漏，让 “from the start up to 1990” 的时间界定更明确、语气更肯定。
the start：开端；创始之初
up to: 直到……（时间 / 数值）
I did have a slide showing our market share in the different parts of the country.
So, the result was that we lost a lot of market share.
In the end, we lost more on BerryAde than we made on AlcoBerry.

Today I'd like to talk about the office paper market and PaperWrite's market share.
Let's start with our share of the market over time.
This slice shows our share of the market from 1950 through last year.
In this graph, you can see our market share rises from 1950 to 1975.
Then it starts to fail until 1998.
Starting in 1998, it stayed at about 12 percent of the market until two years ago, and then it started falling quickly.
Now, we only have about 8 percent of the market share.
So, it is clear that our market share is dropping.
It's important that we find out why this is happening, so we can create a new marketing plan.

| ----- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bob   | 00:00 | So what's this about then, Alice?                            |
| Alice | 00:03 | Well, Cameron's asked me to put together a presentation for the market research people. |
| Bob   | 00:08 | What kind of presentation?                                   |
| Alice | 00:11 | Oh, just a normal PowerPoint presentation about BarryCo products. |
| Bob   | 00:17 | OK, so you want to ask some questions about the product range, is that right? |
| Alice | 00:23 | That's it.                                                   |
| Alice | 00:24 | First, I wanted to know something about AlcoBerry.           |
| Alice | 00:27 | What is it exactly?                                          |
| Bob   | 00:30 | AlcoBerry is berry aid plus alcohol.                         |
| Alice | 00:34 | Okay, where do we sell it now?                               |
| Bob   | 00:38 | We sell it in Europe, but not here in the States.            |
| Alice | 00:42 | Why's that?                                                  |
| Bob   | 00:44 | Some of our major US Clients don't approve of alcoholic drinks. |
| Bob   | 00:48 | So we actually lost market share because of Alcoberry.       |
| Alice | 00:53 | Do you have any figures on that?                             |
| Bob   | 00:56 | I can try and find out and email them to you.                |
| Bob   | 00:59 | So what else do you need to know?                            |
| Alice | 01:02 | Okay, now the next thing is about our sales figures before 1990. |
| Bob   | 01:07 | What about them?                                             |
| Alice | 01:09 | Well, they're not in the database.                           |
| Bob   | 01:13 | Yes, in those days we didn't keep records on a computer.     |
| Alice | 01:17 | So do you have sales records from before 1990?               |
| Bob   | 01:22 | Yeah, I have them in my office.                              |
| Bob   | 01:24 | But they're on paper, not in electronic form.                |
| Bob   | 01:26 | I can give you photocopies.                                  |
| Alice | 01:29 | That's great.                                                |
| Alice | 01:30 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Bob   | 01:32 | Anything else I can help you with?                           |
| Alice | 01:35 | Oh yes.                                                      |
| Alice | 01:36 | Could you look at the presentation when I finished it?       |

| ------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cameron | 00:00 | So when you're ready, Alice.                                 |
| Alice   | 00:03 | Okay, so I'm going to talk about Berryco's products and markets. |
| Cameron | 00:09 | Off you go.                                                  |
| Alice   | 00:11 | This first slide shows a product which you won't find in the United States. |
| Alice   | 00:15 | It's called Alkoberry.                                       |
| Charlie | 00:18 | What on earth is Alcoberry?                                  |
| Alice   | 00:22 | It's BerryAde plus alcohol.                                  |
| Charlie | 00:25 | Okay.                                                        |
| Charlie | 00:25 | What's the market for that?                                  |
| Charlie | 00:27 | I thought BerryAde was mainly aimed at kids.                 |
| Alice   | 00:31 | Oh, we made AlcoBerry for clubs and bars.                    |
| Alice   | 00:34 | It's aimed mainly at young adults.                           |
| Helen   | 00:37 | But you said you don't sell it in the U.S. why's that?       |
| Alice   | 00:43 | Because some of our customers in the U.S. don't approve of alcohol. |
| Helen   | 00:47 | Did you lose market share as a result?                       |
| Alice   | 00:51 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alice   | 00:52 | This bar chart shows that we lost market share in the South. |
| Cameron | 00:56 | Okay, let's move on to the next slide.                       |
| Alice   | 01:01 | This is a graph showing our share of the market since 1965.  |
| Cameron | 01:06 | Would you like to say a bit more about it?                   |
| Alice   | 01:10 | Okay, sure.                                                  |
| Alice   | 01:12 | Well, it rises from 1965 to 1983.                            |
| Alice   | 01:16 | Then it stays about the same till about 1993.                |
| Alice   | 01:19 | And then it starts falling slowly.                           |
| Alice   | 01:22 | Then from 2001, it starts falling faster.                    |
| Charlie | 01:27 | So why is this, do you think?                                |
| Alice   | 01:30 | That's what we want you to find out.                         |
| Charlie | 01:33 | Of course.                                                   |
| Charlie | 01:34 | What's next?                                                 |
| Alice   | 01:37 | This next slide is a bar chart showing the total market and our share of the market. |
| Alice   | 01:41 | The green bar is the total market and the brown bar is our share of the market. |
| Helen   | 01:47 | So the market has been growing, but your share has been falling. |
| Alice   | 01:53 | That's right.                                                |
| Cameron | 01:55 | On you go, Alice.                                            |
| Alice   | 01:58 | And this is the last slide.                                  |
| Alice   | 02:00 | A bottle of BerryAde with a question mark.                   |
| Charlie | 02:03 | What's the question mark for?                                |
| Alice   | 02:06 | It means, what's the future for BerryAde?                    |
| Charlie | 02:11 | Well, thanks, Alice.                                         |
| Charlie | 02:12 | That was a great presentation.                               |
| Helen   | 02:14 | Yeah, I really enjoyed it.                                   |
| Charlie | 02:17 | Well done, Alice.                                            |
| Alice   | 02:20 | My pleasure.                                                 |

I need you to brief the market research people on our products.
I only want you to show our product range, not our market share.
You'll need to put together the information yourself.
I was nervous because I had to give three presentations about the new marketing plan.
You should use PowerPoint to give your presentation.
You should show about ten slides at the meeting.
This product was made specially for children.
This grap shows the state of the market in 2000.
The result of our marketing plan was that our sales went up.
You can see in this graph that from 2005 to last year our market share rises from 8 to 10 percent.
Now we have more of the share of the total market.
Please carry on with your presentation.
请继续你的演讲。
carry on with: 继续
The assistant always prints the slides from important meeting and writes notes on them.
