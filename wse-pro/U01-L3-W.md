Is Max the COO? I thought he was something to do with IT.
Max是COO吗？我还以为他是搞信息技术相关工作的呢。

You need to read the company's organization chart.
你得好好看看公司的组织架构图。
I'm Alice Pettitt, Cameron Diallo's assistant.
Max Danos, Chief Operating Officer.
I'm Bob Harrison, VP of Sales.
I hope you invited Laura.
Yes, you said to invite all the senior managers.
您之前说要邀请所有高层管理者。
You mean Laura Balin, the CFO?
She's just the Director of Finance.
她只是财务总监而已。
We don't have a CFO yet.

Al Blaine is our COO, or Chief Operating Officer.
All the senior managers and their job titles are in the company's organization chart.
Who's the CFO? We don't have a Chief Financial Officer.
Ms. Aziz is just the Director of Finance, not the CFO.
Most of the senior managers are VPs, or Vice Presidents.
For example, the guy is charge of computers and IT is called Head of IT.
And the Diretor of Sales is called VP of Sales.
