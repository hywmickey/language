Is Max the COO? I thought he was something to do with IT.
Max是COO吗？我还以为他是搞信息技术相关工作的呢。
You're thinking of Sunil Gupta. He's the head of IT.
你说的应该是苏尼尔・古普塔。他才是信息技术部门的负责人。
You need to read the company's organization chart.
你得好好看看公司的组织架构图。
I'm Alice Pettitt, Cameron Diallo's assistant.
Max Danos, Chief Operating Officer.
I'm Bob Harrison, VP of Sales.
I hope you invited Laura.
Yes, you said to invite all the senior managers.
您之前说要邀请所有高层管理者。
You mean Laura Balin, the CFO?
She's just the Director of Finance.
她只是财务总监而已。
We don't have a CFO yet.
```

# test
Al Blaine is our COO, or Chief Operating Officer.
All the senior managers and their job titles are in the company's organization chart.
Who's the CFO? We don't have a Chief Financial Officer.
Ms. Aziz is just the Director of Finance, not the CFO.
