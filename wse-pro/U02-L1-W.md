| Cameron | 00:14:00 | He can't be here, I'm afraid.                                |
| Cameron | 00:17:00 | He's going to join us by conference call.                    |

| Steve   | 00:26:00 | And I'd like you all to listen carefully.                    |
| Steve   | 00:28:00 | Okay, Cameron, take it away.                                 |
| Cameron | 00:31:00 | Thanks, Steve.                                               |
| Cameron | 00:33:00 | So, first off, thank you all for coming to the meeting.      |
| Max     | 00:38:00 | That's all right.                                            |
| Max     | 00:39:00 | But I do have another meeting shortly.                       |
| Max     | 00:42:00 | Can we get down to business?                                 |
| Bob     | 00:44:00 | Aren't we going to talk about market.                        |

| Cameron | 00:47:00 | We need a lot more market information.                       |
| Bob     | 00:52:00 | Do you mean market research?                                 |
| Cameron | 00:55:00 | Yes.                                                         |
| Cameron | 00:56:00 | We're thinking of hiring a market research agency.           |

| Max     | 01:21:00 | Well, I have no problem with this.                           |
| Max     | 01:23:00 | But if you'll excuse me, I have to go now.                   |
| Cameron | 01:28:00 | Does anyone else have anything else they want to say before we close the meeting? |

| Role    | Time     | Sentence                                                     |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cameron | 00:00:00 | So we're going to hire a market research company.            |
| Bob     | 00:05:00 | What do we want them to find out?                            |
| Cameron | 00:07:00 | We need to understand why our market share has fallen.       |
| Bob     | 00:13:00 | I think it's because we don't have enough salespeople.       |
| Cameron | 00:17:00 | I'm sorry, but I don't agree, Bob.                           |
| Bob     | 00:21:00 | Why not?                                                     |
| Cameron | 00:23:00 | Our market share was falling even when we had more salespeople than we do now. |
| Dominic | 00:30:00 | We need to find out what our old customers are drinking now. |
| Cameron | 00:34:00 | Ok. What does anyone else think about that?                  |
| Bob     | 00:39:00 | Who cares what they're drinking now?                         |
| Bob     | 00:41:00 | They're not drinking BerryAde.                               |
| Bob     | 00:42:00 | That's the point.                                            |
| Alice   | 00:44:00 | I think we need to find out what people think of BerryAde.   |
| Alice   | 00:47:00 | Especially people who don't drink it anymore.                |
| Cameron | 00:50:00 | That's a great idea.                                         |
| Cameron | 00:52:00 | Any other points?                                            |
| Bob     | 00:55:00 | Where do these market research firms come from?              |
| Cameron | 00:59:00 | I'm looking at two of them.                                  |
| Cameron | 01:01:00 | One local and one from New York.                             |
| Bob     | 01:05:00 | I think we should use a local firm.                          |
| Bob     | 01:07:00 | How can people from New York understand our local market conditions? |
| Cameron | 01:12:00 | What does anyone else think about that point?                |
| Max     | 01:17:00 | I think we want to use the best firm we can find.            |
| Max     | 01:20:00 | A good market research firm can understand any market.       |
| Max     | 01:23:00 | That's their job.                                            |
| Cameron | 01:26:00 | I agree with you, Max.                                       |
| Cameron | 01:28:00 | So I think that's everything for now.                        |
| Cameron | 01:31:00 | Alice, have you taken notes?                                 |
| Alice   | 01:34:00 | Yes, of course.                                              |
| Cameron | 01:37:00 | So send them to me as soon as possible, please.              |
| Cameron | 01:41:00 | And thank you all for coming to the meeting.                 |

I canceled my other meeting.
Martin will join us by conference call.
Please enter your password, followed by pound.
Try to listen with an open mind.
The goal of this meeting is to discuss the marketing plan.
We will discuss your sales plan later.
My first point is that we don't need so many salespeople.
Martin already approved the budget.
Salespeople and market research experts have different skills.
Just write down what people say, not your opinions.

Let's get started.
Luisa will take notes on the meeting.
Great idea, Kim. Anyone else?
Max, any thoughts?
I think it's just plain crazy.
我认为这简直太疯狂了。
That's why we have lower sales.
I'll let you know when I'm done.
Please report back to me after the meeting.
The reason is that we don't have the information.
Well done, Lusia.
