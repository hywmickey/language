| Alice   | 00:04 | Morning.                                                     |
| Dominic | 00:04 | Ah, Alice.                                                   |
| Dominic | 00:05 | Have you arranged our Asia itinerary yet?                    |
| Alice   | 00:08 | What Asia itinerary is that?                                 |
| Dominic | 00:11 | Oh, haven't you heard?                                       |
| Dominic | 00:13 | Cameron, Steve and I are going on a trip to China, Korea and Japan. |
| Dominic | 00:18 | I suppose Cameron will tell you about it sooner or later.    |
| Alice   | 00:23 | So you're going to Japan first, presumably.                  |
| Cameron | 00:26 | Why do you assume that?                                      |
| Alice   | 00:27 | Well, because it's sort of on the way.                       |
| Alice   | 00:30 | I mean, it's nearer to California than Seoul or Shanghai.    |
| Cameron | 00:33 | There's one hour difference in flight time.                  |
| Cameron | 00:35 | It's not significant.                                        |
| Cameron | 00:37 | You know what?                                               |
| Cameron | 00:38 | I think we'll start in Shanghai.                             |
| Cameron | 00:40 | The Chinese company said their people would be available anytime that week. |
| Alice   | 00:44 | So how long do you need in Shanghai?                         |
| Alice   | 00:46 | Two full days.                                               |
| Cameron | 00:48 | That should be enough.                                       |
| Cameron | 00:49 | Yes, we've got the two formal meetings plus a visit to the factory. |
| Alice   | 00:53 | Do you want to add in a bit of time for sightseeing?         |
| Cameron | 00:56 | How thoughtful of you.                                       |
| Cameron | 00:57 | Okay, give us a couple of hours for shopping if you can fit it in. |
| Alice   | 01:01 | I'm sure the Chinese will arrange something for you anyway.  |
| Cameron | 01:04 | Yeah, you're probably right.                                 |
| Cameron | 01:05 | So find out what it is and put it in the itinerary.          |
| Cameron | 01:08 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron | 01:08 | I think we'll go to Seoul next.                              |
| Cameron | 01:10 | We've got three people to meet, but one of them hasn't confirmed, so can you check with them first? |
| Alice   | 01:16 | Sorry, check with who?                                       |
| Cameron | 01:17 | With the people who haven't confirmed, obviously.            |
| Cameron | 01:20 | Who do you think?                                            |
| Alice   | 01:21 | I'm sorry, Cameron, I don't know who you mean.               |
| Alice   | 01:23 | I haven't seen the correspondence.                           |
| Cameron | 01:25 | Oh, I see.                                                   |
| Cameron | 01:26 | Okay, I'll forward the emails to you.                        |
| Alice   | 01:28 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Cameron | 01:29 | So we stay two or three days in Seoul, depending on whether that meeting happens or not. |
| Cameron | 01:34 | And then to Tokyo, of course, for the press conference.      |
| Alice   | 01:37 | The press conference?                                        |
| Cameron | 01:38 | It was arranged a couple of days ago.                        |
| Cameron | 01:40 | I'll forward you the details.                                |
| Alice   | 01:42 | Great.                                                       |
| Alice   | 01:42 | But am I supposed to organize anything?                      |
| Cameron | 01:45 | No, no.                                                      |
| Cameron | 01:46 | The Japanese PR company is taking care of everything.        |
| Cameron | 01:49 | Just put us in a nice hotel that's not too far from the venue. |
| Cameron | 01:53 | In fact, I think the venue is a hotel, so we can stay there. |
| Cameron | 01:57 | One last thing.                                              |
| Cameron | 01:58 | We're taking Dominic with us.                                |
| Cameron | 02:00 | He carried out the research on the Japanese market, so this is a kind of reward. |
| Alice   | 02:04 | Great.                                                       |
| Alice   | 02:06 | Cool.                                                        |
| Alice   | 02:07 | Good for him.                                                |
| Alice   | 02:09 | Oh, yes.                                                     |
| Alice   | 02:09 | Do you need any extra time in Japan?                         |
| Cameron | 02:12 | You mean to climb Mount Fuji or something?                   |
| Cameron | 02:14 | No, thanks.                                                  |
| Cameron | 02:15 | We'll come straight back to the States the day after the press conference. |
| Alice   | 02:22 | Yes, can I speak with Ms. Zhao, please?                      |
| Alice   | 02:26 | It's spelled Z H, A O. I'm sorry, I don't know how it's pronounced. |
| Alice   | 02:32 | Okay.                                                        |
| Alice   | 02:33 | Zhao.                                                        |
| Alice   | 02:34 | Is that right?                                               |
| Alice   | 02:36 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Alice   | 02:37 | So can I speak to Ms. Zhao, please?                          |
| Lucy    | 02:41 | Hello, this is Lucy Zhao Speaking.                           |
| Lucy    | 02:44 | Is this Alice?                                               |
| Alice   | 02:45 | That's right.                                                |
| Alice   | 02:46 | Did you get my email?                                        |
| Lucy    | 02:48 | Oh, yes, no problem.                                         |
| Lucy    | 02:51 | I'm sorry I didn't reply, but my boss is away.               |
| Alice   | 02:55 | It's all right.                                              |
| Alice   | 02:56 | I don't need to speak to him.                                |
| Alice   | 02:58 | I just wanted to know what you'd planned for Thursday afternoon after the meeting. |
| Lucy    | 03:03 | I'm sorry, I don't know.                                     |
| Lucy    | 03:05 | I just know that he's arranged something special.            |
| Alice   | 03:10 | Oh, I see.                                                   |
| Alice   | 03:11 | Without telling you?                                         |
| Alice   | 03:12 | Sounds just like my boss.                                    |
| Alice   | 03:15 | They will be through by Thursday evening, right?             |
| Alice   | 03:18 | They have to leave Shanghai Friday morning.                  |
| Lucy    | 03:20 | I'm sure that will be no problem.                            |
| Alice   | 03:26 | Oh, hello, Dominic.                                          |
| Alice   | 03:28 | Can I help you?                                              |
| Dominic | 03:29 | Yes, it's about our hotel in Tokyo.                          |
| Dominic | 03:33 | Did you say you were going to put us in the New Century?     |
| Alice   | 03:36 | Yes, that's right.                                           |
| Alice   | 03:37 | Is there a problem?                                          |
| Dominic | 03:39 | I've just been looking it up on the Internet and it certainly isn't the best. |
| Dominic | 03:44 | The Tokyo Palace seems to be the top one.                    |
| Dominic | 03:47 | So I think you should book us into that.                     |
| Alice   | 03:50 | Sorry, Dominic, but the press conference is in the new century. |
| Alice   | 03:53 | That's why Cameron decided to stay there.                    |
| Alice   | 03:56 | You can always go and talk with her if you want to change it. |
| Dominic | 04:00 | Oh, okay. Just wondering.                                    |
| Alice   | 04:04 | Was there anything else?                                     |
| Dominic | 04:05 | Yes, just one thing.                                         |
| Dominic | 04:09 | Cameron and Steve are flying business class, obviously.      |
| Alice   | 04:13 | Yes, of course.                                              |
| Dominic | 04:15 | Well, what about me?                                         |
| Alice   | 04:18 | I put you in coach.                                          |
| Alice   | 04:20 | That's company policy.                                       |
| Alice   | 04:21 | As you know, only senior managers fly business.              |
| Dominic | 04:25 | No, I was just thinking as I'm traveling with them.          |
| Dominic | 04:29 | Wouldn't it be more logical if I flew business class too?    |
| Alice   | 04:33 | I'm sorry, Dominic, Again.                                   |
| Alice   | 04:34 | It's something you'll have to bring up with Cameron.         |
| Dominic | 04:40 | Are you going to finalize the itinerary now?                 |
| Alice   | 04:43 | That's the idea, yes.                                        |
| Dominic | 04:45 | Great.                                                       |
| Steve   | 04:48 | Well, thanks for organizing all this, Alice.                 |
| Steve   | 04:51 | We must bring you back a gift.                               |
| Steve   | 04:53 | Any suggestions?                                             |
| Alice   | 04:54 | Oh, no need.                                                 |
| Alice   | 04:55 | Just doing my job.                                           |
| Cameron | 04:57 | Sorry to keep you.                                           |
| Cameron | 04:58 | Would you believe Liam Connolly again?                       |
| Cameron | 05:01 | That man never gives up.                                     |
| Steve   | 05:03 | That's the way to be successful.                             |
| Cameron | 05:05 | It's the way to be a pain in the butt.                       |
| Cameron | 05:07 | Anyway, we're here to review the itinerary.                  |
| Cameron | 05:10 | Do you have any comments, Steve?                             |
| Steve   | 05:12 | Looks good to me.                                            |
| Steve   | 05:14 | Just one thing, Alice.                                       |
| Steve   | 05:15 | The hotel in Tokyo.                                          |
| Steve   | 05:17 | The New Century is okay for a press conference, but we don't want to stay there. |
| Alice   | 05:21 | I'll change the booking, shall I?                            |
| Alice   | 05:23 | How about the Tokyo Palace?                                  |
| Steve   | 05:25 | The Palace, yeah.                                            |
| Steve   | 05:26 | Great choice.                                                |
| Steve   | 05:27 | Have you been to Tokyo then?                                 |
| Alice   | 05:29 | No, no.                                                      |
| Alice   | 05:30 | I just did some research, you know.                          |
| Cameron | 05:31 | If that's all you have, Steve.                               |
| Steve   | 05:34 | I'm done.                                                    |
| Cameron | 05:35 | Well, it all looks good to me too.                           |
| Cameron | 05:37 | All nonstop flights.                                         |
| Cameron | 05:39 | No layovers or changes of plane.                             |
| Cameron | 05:42 | Oh, yeah.                                                    |
| Cameron | 05:43 | Just one thing.                                              |
| Cameron | 05:45 | The Thursday afternoon in Shanghai you haven't put down what we're doing. |
| Alice   | 05:49 | The person I spoke to didn't know her boss hadn't told her.  |
| Cameron | 05:53 | Right.                                                       |
| Cameron | 05:53 | That figures.                                                |
| Steve   | 05:54 | That's the Chinese way.                                      |
| Cameron | 05:56 | Chinese managers never tell their staff what's going on.     |
| Steve   | 05:59 | Aren't you glad we do things differently here?               |
