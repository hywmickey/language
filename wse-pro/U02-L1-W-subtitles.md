| Cameron         | 00:00 | Good morning, Bob.                                           |
| Bob             | 00:02 | Morning.                                                     |
| Dominic         | 00:02 | Hello, Bob.                                                  |
| Dominic         | 00:04 | I thought you were in Phoenix.                               |
| Bob             | 00:07 | No, I canceled my meetings.                                  |
| Cameron         | 00:09 | Okay, let's get started.                                     |
| Cameron         | 00:11 | It's already 9:05, so I'm glad you all could come.           |
| Cameron         | 00:14 | As you probably know, Steve has to be in Chicago today, so he'll join us by conference call and Alice will take notes. |
| Cameron         | 00:22 | This will be Steve.                                          |

| Conference Call | 00:40 | You will now be placed into conference.                      |
| Steve           | 00:45 | Hello.                                                       |
| Cameron         | 00:46 | Steve, we're all here now.                                   |
| Cameron         | 00:47 | We have Max, Bob, Dominic, Laura and Alice.                  |
| Steve           | 00:51 | Hi there guys, and thank you for coming.                     |
| Steve           | 00:53 | I'm sorry I can't join you this morning, but I just wanted to give you a quick message. |
| Steve           | 00:59 | What Cameron has to say is very important for the future of this company. |
| Steve           | 01:04 | And I'd like you all to listen with an open mind.            |
| Steve           | 01:07 | And Cameron will report back to me on what happens.          |
| Steve           | 01:10 | So have a great meeting and I'll see you when I'm back in the office. |
| Cameron         | 01:13 | Bye, Steve.                                                  |
| Cameron         | 01:15 | Okay, the goal of this meeting, as you know, is to talk about the new marketing plan. |
| Cameron         | 01:20 | Well, you know what?                                         |
| Cameron         | 01:22 | There is no marketing plan.                                  |
| Cameron         | 01:23 | I don't have one.                                            |
| Cameron         | 01:25 | And the reason is that we don't have the information.        |
| Cameron         | 01:31 | This company has almost no information about its customers.  |
| Cameron         | 01:35 | All we know is that our market share has gone down.          |
| Cameron         | 01:38 | In 1990, we had 8% of the United States soft drinks market.  |
| Cameron         | 01:43 | In 2000 we had 6.5%.                                         |
| Cameron         | 01:46 | And last year we had 4.6%.                                   |
| Cameron         | 01:49 | But we don't know why it keeps going down.                   |
| Bob             | 01:52 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Bob             | 01:52 | But we do know why.                                          |
| Bob             | 01:54 | It's because we don't have enough salespeople.               |
| Bob             | 01:57 | We keep firing them.                                         |
| Cameron         | 01:58 | Thanks Bob, but I'd just like to finish what I have to say first and then we can discuss all the points together afterwards. |
| Cameron         | 02:06 | Does that work for you?                                      |
| Bob             | 02:08 | Whatever you say.                                            |
| Cameron         | 02:10 | So we're losing market share year on year.                   |
| Cameron         | 02:12 | Now we may all have our ideas about why that is, but we don't have any hard information. |
| Cameron         | 02:18 | So we're going to hire a market research agency to do a study of our market and our customers. |
| Bob             | 02:25 | Isn't that Dominic's job?                                    |
| Bob             | 02:26 | How much more market research do we need?                    |
| Cameron         | 02:30 | Dominic is doing a great job, but there's just too much for him to do by himself. |
| Laura           | 02:36 | May I ask a question, please?                                |
| Laura           | 02:38 | How much is all this going to cost?                          |
| Laura           | 02:40 | I mean, we don't even have a budget for market research.     |
| Laura           | 02:43 | Except for Dominic.                                          |
| Cameron         | 02:44 | It's okay.                                                   |
| Cameron         | 02:45 | Steve has already approved the budget.                       |
| Laura           | 02:47 | Oh, has he?                                                  |
| Laura           | 02:48 | Well, he hasn't told me about it.                            |
| Cameron         | 02:50 | Well, I'm sure he'll talk to you about it when he Comes back. |
| Cameron         | 02:53 | So I'm looking at two market research firms.                 |
| Cameron         | 02:56 | One local firm from L. A and one from New York.              |
| Cameron         | 02:59 | I'm going to ask them to come here and tell us some of their ideas. |
| Cameron         | 03:02 | But first we need to tell them what we're looking for.       |
| Dominic         | 03:06 | Well, I think we need to know what our old customers are drinking now. |
| Bob             | 03:10 | Who cares what they're drinking now?                         |
| Bob             | 03:12 | They're not drinking our product.                            |
| Bob             | 03:14 | That's what matters.                                         |
| Cameron         | 03:15 | Good point.                                                  |
| Cameron         | 03:16 | Thanks, Dominic.                                             |
| Cameron         | 03:17 | Any other ideas?                                             |
| Alice           | 03:19 | Well, I think we need to know what people think of BerryAde. |
| Alice           | 03:23 | I think we need to look at three groups of people.           |
| Alice           | 03:26 | The ones who still drink BerryAde, the ones who drank it before but don't drink it now. |
| Alice           | 03:31 | And the ones who have never drunk it.                        |
| Cameron         | 03:34 | Yeah, great idea, Alice.                                     |
| Cameron         | 03:35 | Anyone else?                                                 |
| Cameron         | 03:37 | Max, any thoughts?                                           |
| Max             | 03:39 | I approve.                                                   |
| Max             | 03:40 | We don't have enough information about our business.         |
| Cameron         | 03:42 | Right.                                                       |
| Cameron         | 03:43 | Thanks, Max.                                                 |
| Cameron         | 03:44 | So, anyone else?                                             |
| Bob             | 03:46 | Well, you know what I think.                                 |
| Bob             | 03:47 | We can get all the market information we need from our salespeople. |
| Bob             | 03:52 | They're out there in the market every day talking to customers. |
| Bob             | 03:56 | But we're gonna hire some guys from New York who know nothing about our product or our market. |
| Bob             | 04:01 | And pay them a ton of money.                                 |
| Bob             | 04:03 | It's just plain crazy.                                       |
| Cameron         | 04:05 | We have had this conversation before, Bob, but I'll answer your points again. |
| Cameron         | 04:10 | First point, with lower sales, we don't need so many salespeople. And the .... |
| Bob             | 04:15 | That's why we have lower sales, because we don't have enough salespeople. |
| Cameron         | 04:20 | And the second point is salespeople and market research experts have completely different skills. |
| Cameron         | 04:27 | When you need market research information, you have to go to experts. |
| Cameron         | 04:32 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Cameron         | 04:33 | Well, that's all we have time for.                           |
| Cameron         | 04:35 | Thank you again for coming.                                  |
| Cameron         | 04:36 | I'll let you know about the market research meeting. Yes, Bob. |
| Bob             | 04:39 | I have something else to say.                                |
| Bob             | 04:41 | I have a new sales plan which I'd like to talk about.        |
| Cameron         | 04:44 | Oh, really?                                                  |
| Cameron         | 04:46 | Well, I'm sorry.                                             |
| Cameron         | 04:47 | I have a 10 o' clock meeting, so I have to go.               |
| Cameron         | 04:49 | But if the others can stay.                                  |
| Dominic         | 04:52 | Of course, with pleasure.                                    |
| Max             | 04:55 | I have 35 minutes before my next meeting.                    |
| Cameron         | 04:58 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron         | 04:59 | Then Alice can report back to me later.                      |
| Cameron         | 05:01 | So, once again, thank you everyone.                          |
| Cameron         | 05:03 | See you later.                                               |
| Bob             | 05:06 | I've done some market research too.                          |
| Bob             | 05:08 | And I found something very interesting.                      |
| Bob             | 05:11 | If you look at small stores, not big supermarkets, our product is in only 8% of them. |
| Bob             | 05:18 | And the reason is that we don't have enough salespeople.     |
| Cameron         | 05:23 | Hello, Alice.                                                |
| Cameron         | 05:24 | I wanted to talk about your notes on the meeting.            |
| Alice           | 05:26 | I hope you were happy with them.                             |
| Cameron         | 05:28 | Please don't write things like Bob was angry.                |
| Cameron         | 05:32 | Just write down what people said.                            |
| Cameron         | 05:34 | Nothing more.                                                |
| Alice           | 05:35 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Cameron         | 05:35 | And you didn't say much about Bob's sales plan or anything that happened after I left. |
| Alice           | 05:41 | Oh, I guess I didn't think you were very interested in Bob's sales plan or that anyone else was. |
| Cameron         | 05:47 | Alice, Bob is a senior manager of this company.              |
| Cameron         | 05:50 | Your job in a meeting is to write down what he says and what anyone else says, and that's all. |
| Cameron         | 05:56 | If I want your opinions, I'll ask for them.                  |
| Cameron         | 05:59 | Got that?                                                    |
| Alice           | 06:00 | I'm sorry.                                                   |
| Cameron         | 06:01 | It's all right.                                              |
| Cameron         | 06:02 | Anyway, that's all.                                          |
| Cameron         | 06:04 | Oh, I liked what you said in the meeting.                    |
| Cameron         | 06:07 | Well done.                                                   |
| Alice           | 06:08 | Thank you.                                                   |
| Alice           | 06:09 | Bye, Cameron.                                                |
