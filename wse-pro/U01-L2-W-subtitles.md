| Alice        | 00:01 | You wanted me?                                               |
| Cameron      | 00:02 | Hi, Alice.                                                   |
| Cameron      | 00:03 | Come in.                                                     |
| Cameron      | 00:04 | Steve and I have been going over the details of our European trip. |
| Cameron      | 00:08 | So we're ready to start booking flights and hotels.          |
| Steve        | 00:12 | I'll leave you to get on with it.                            |
| Cameron      | 00:16 | So our first meeting is in Madrid, Spain on May 28th at 11 am. |
| Alice        | 00:21 | so, do you want to.                                          |
| Cameron      | 00:22 | I don't think there's a direct flight from here to Madrid.   |
| Cameron      | 00:24 | So if we leave on the evening of the 27th, it's not going to work if we have to change planes in Europe. |
| Alice        | 00:32 | Maybe if you leave in the morning of the 27th or the afternoon. |
| Cameron      | 00:35 | No, no, impossible.                                          |
| Cameron      | 00:37 | All the flights to Europe are overnight.                     |
| Cameron      | 00:39 | So find out if there's a direct flight to Madrid from here.  |
| Cameron      | 00:43 | Or see if we can change planes in the States and arrive in Madrid by 9 am and book a hotel in Madrid for the night of the 27th. |
| Cameron      | 00:53 | Okay, then we've got two meetings in Paris on the 28th and the 31st. |
| Alice        | 00:59 | The 28th and 31st?                                           |
| Cameron      | 01:02 | Yes, Friday the 28th and Monday the 31st.                    |
| Cameron      | 01:05 | Is there a problem?                                          |
| Alice        | 01:07 | No, of course not.                                           |
| Alice        | 01:08 | I just.                                                      |
| Alice        | 01:10 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Alice        | 01:10 | It doesn't matter.                                           |
| Cameron      | 01:11 | Good.                                                        |
| Cameron      | 01:12 | So we fly from Madrid to Paris on the morning of the 28th.   |
| Cameron      | 01:16 | An early flight.                                             |
| Cameron      | 01:17 | The meeting's at 11:30.                                      |
| Cameron      | 01:20 | Then a hotel in Paris from the 28th through the 30th, checking out on the 31st. And then .... |
| Alice        | 01:26 | Just one thing.                                              |
| Cameron      | 01:28 | Yes?                                                         |
| Alice        | 01:29 | Any particular hotel?                                        |
| Alice        | 01:31 | I mean, do you have any preferences?                         |
| Cameron      | 01:35 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron      | 01:36 | Not one of those huge business hotels.                       |
| Cameron      | 01:38 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron      | 01:39 | Some little place with a bit of character.                   |
| Cameron      | 01:43 | Okay, then we have London on June 1st in the morning.        |
| Alice        | 01:47 | So you'll fly Paris, London on May 31st, stay in London that evening, then you're back here the afternoon of the 1st. |
| Cameron      | 01:54 | That's it.                                                   |
| Cameron      | 01:55 | There are plenty of flights from London, so make sure we get a non stop arriving around 6 to 7 pm. |
| Alice        | 02:02 | I'll go and work on it now.                                  |
| Cameron      | 02:03 | Email the itinerary to me as soon as it's ready, Okay?       |
| Alice        | 02:10 | It says on your website that you have a direct flight from New York to Madrid. |
| Alice        | 02:16 | Oh, I see.                                                   |
| Alice        | 02:17 | Can you hold on, please?                                     |
| Alice        | 02:20 | Dominic, they've only got first class seats left.            |
| Alice        | 02:23 | Does the company pay for first class for senior managers?    |
| Alice        | 02:26 | What's the policy?                                           |
| Dominic      | 02:28 | Oh no, they always fly coats.                                |
| Alice        | 02:30 | Yeah, very funny.                                            |
| Alice        | 02:32 | Look, come on, I've got the travel agent on hold and Cameron told me to book them in business. |
| Dominic      | 02:38 | The policy is to fly business class only.                    |
| Dominic      | 02:40 | You'll have to find another route.                           |
| Alice        | 02:42 | Are you sure?                                                |
| Dominic      | 02:43 | Why ask if you don't want to know the answer?                |
| Alice        | 02:46 | Sorry to keep you.                                           |
| Alice        | 02:48 | Look, can you book New York to Madrid in first, I'll get back to you if it changes. |
| Alice        | 02:54 | And then Madrid, Paris and Paris, London in business, please. |
| Alice        | 02:59 | Yeah, that's it.                                             |
| Alice        | 03:01 | Can you email me the itinerary when you've confirmed it, please? |
| Alice        | 03:04 | A Pettit.                                                    |
| Alice        | 03:06 | That's apettitt@barryco-inc.com.                             |
| Alice        | 03:18 | okay, thanks.                                                |
| Alice        | 03:19 | Bye.                                                         |
| Alice        | 03:24 | Excuse me, Dominic.                                          |
| Alice        | 03:26 | I was wondering, do you know Paris at all?                   |
| Dominic      | 03:29 | No, I've never been there.                                   |
| Dominic      | 03:31 | Why?                                                         |
| Alice        | 03:32 | Well, Cameron wanted a small hotel with character.           |
| Alice        | 03:35 | Do you know what sort of place she'd like?                   |
| Dominic      | 03:37 | The only hotel in Paris I can think of is the George Sank, where all the Stars Go. |
| Alice        | 03:43 | You mean as in George V?                                     |
| Dominic      | 03:45 | That's right.                                                |
| Dominic      | 03:46 | But it costs about €2,000 a night and it's huge.             |
| Alice        | 03:50 | Oh, no, that's no good then, is it?                          |
| Alice        | 03:54 | I'll do a search for boutique hotel in Paris.                |
| Alice        | 04:05 | Oh, hello.                                                   |
| Alice        | 04:06 | I called you about 20 minutes ago asking about rooms for May 28th, 29th and 30th. |
| Receptionist | 04:13 | Ah, yes, Mrs. Petite.                                        |
| Alice        | 04:16 | Pettit.                                                      |
| Alice        | 04:16 | Alice Pettit.                                                |
| Receptionist | 04:18 | Oh, yes, sorry.                                              |
| Receptionist | 04:20 | Well, we have one standard room and one executive suite for those dates. |
| Receptionist | 04:24 | Are they staying the 30th or checking out on the 30th?       |
| Alice        | 04:28 | Staying the 30th and checking out the 31st.                  |
| Alice        | 04:32 | So how much are the rooms, please?                           |
| Receptionist | 04:35 | The standard room is €230 and the executive suite is €510.   |
| Alice        | 04:42 | A night?                                                     |
| Receptionist | 04:43 | Yes, of course.                                              |
| Receptionist | 04:44 | Breakfast is not included.                                   |
| Alice        | 04:47 | Well, all right.                                             |
| Alice        | 04:49 | Can you hold them and send me a quote in US dollars, please, not euros? |
| Receptionist | 04:54 | I can only hold them for three hours.                        |
| Alice        | 04:56 | It's all right.                                              |
| Alice        | 04:57 | I'll get back to you within an hour.                         |
| Alice        | 04:59 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Receptionist | 05:00 | My pleasure.                                                 |
| Dominic      | 05:03 | So they're spending the weekend in Paris, are they?          |
| Alice        | 05:07 | Yes.                                                         |
| Dominic      | 05:08 | But you booked two rooms, not one.                           |
| Alice        | 05:12 | Later, Dominic.                                              |
| Alice        | 05:20 | I hope the Paris hotel is good.                              |
| Alice        | 05:22 | I checked it out on several travel websites.                 |
| Cameron      | 05:25 | Good, I see we're flying first class from New York to Madrid. |
| Cameron      | 05:30 | Didn't I tell you to book only business class?               |
| Alice        | 05:32 | Sorry, Cameron, they only had coach or first.                |
| Cameron      | 05:37 | So why didn't you try a different route?                     |
| Alice        | 05:40 | Sorry, it's just that Dominic said.                          |
| Alice        | 05:43 | I just wanted you to be comfortable.                         |
| Cameron      | 05:45 | How sweet.                                                   |
| Cameron      | 05:46 | Anyway, don't worry, Alice, you did the right thing.         |
| Alice        | 05:49 | Oh, really?                                                  |
| Cameron      | 05:51 | Yes, of course.                                              |
| Cameron      | 05:52 | I told you to put us on that flight and you did.             |
| Cameron      | 05:55 | Is there a problem?                                          |
| Alice        | 05:57 | No, no, no problem.                                          |
| Cameron      | 05:59 | So, off you go and confirm the hotels, and email me as soon as you know. |
