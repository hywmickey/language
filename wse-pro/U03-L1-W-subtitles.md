| Max Danos      | 00:09 | Hello, Max Danos.                                            |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:10 | Hello, Max?                                                  |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:11 | This is Alfredo Marron, general manager of the Berrico plant in Chichon. |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:16 | I'm afraid we have a little problem, Max.                    |
| Max Danos      | 00:19 | What kind of problem?                                        |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:20 | There's been an accident in the factory.                     |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:24 | Oh, it's not that serious.                                   |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:26 | Nobody has died or anything.                                 |
| Max Danos      | 00:29 | Okay, so what procedure did you follow?                      |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:31 | Of course I shut down the factory.                           |
| Max Danos      | 00:33 | That was correct.                                            |
| Max Danos      | 00:34 | If you followed the correct procedure, you don't need to call me. |
| Max Danos      | 00:37 | Just put the details into your weekly report.                |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:40 | There is something else, I'm afraid.                         |
| Max Danos      | 00:43 | What?                                                        |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:43 | Before we realized that there was a problem, some bottles left the factory. |
| Max Danos      | 00:48 | Were these bottles contaminated in any way?                  |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:51 | Maybe.                                                       |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:52 | I'm not sure.                                                |
| Max Danos      | 00:53 | What do you mean you're not sure?                            |
| Max Danos      | 00:56 | What about your quality control?                             |
| Alfredo Marron | 00:57 | Well, quality control didn't say anything.                   |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:01 | But you know.                                                |
| Max Danos      | 01:03 | No, I don't know.                                            |
| Max Danos      | 01:05 | Anyway, you know the procedure to follow in these situations. |
| Max Danos      | 01:09 | First, find all the bottles which left the factory after the accident and get them back. |
| Max Danos      | 01:14 | Second, tell me how many there were exactly.                 |
| Max Danos      | 01:18 | Third, take a look at your quality control procedure and tell me how you plan to improve it. |
| Max Danos      | 01:24 | Report back to me not later than this time tomorrow, please. |
| Max Danos      | 01:26 | Have you got all that?                                       |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:29 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:30 | There is just one more thing.                                |
| Max Danos      | 01:33 | What is it now?                                              |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:34 | You see, there was some journalists visiting the factory.    |
| Max Danos      | 01:38 | Do they know about the contaminated bottles?                 |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:40 | I'm afraid so.                                               |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:42 | There's a story in today's paper.                            |
| Max Danos      | 01:45 | In today's paper?                                            |
| Max Danos      | 01:46 | So when did this all happen?                                 |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:48 | Yesterday morning.                                           |
| Max Danos      | 01:49 | What?                                                        |
| Max Danos      | 01:50 | Then why didn't you inform me yesterday?                     |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:52 | I'm really sorry.                                            |
| Alfredo Marron | 01:54 | It's only a small story.                                     |
| Max Danos      | 01:56 | This is extremely serious.                                   |
| Max Danos      | 01:59 | Don't leave your office.                                     |
| Max Danos      | 02:00 | Keep your office phone and your cell phone on at all times and wait for me to get back to you. |
| Max Danos      | 02:05 | Goodbye.                                                     |
| Steve Lee      | 02:10 | Hell, Max, what's going on with these guys in Chichon?       |
| Steve Lee      | 02:13 | Where's their quality control?                               |
| Steve Lee      | 02:15 | Can you help me here?                                        |
| Max Danos      | 02:16 | Their quality control isn't good enough, Clearly.            |
| Max Danos      | 02:18 | But I didn't prioritize Chichon.                             |
| Max Danos      | 02:21 | I gave higher priority to larger markets like Germany and China, which also had serious problems, if you remember. |
| Steve Lee      | 02:29 | Okay, I can see that.                                        |
| Steve Lee      | 02:31 | But remember, a small place like Chichon can cause a big problem. |
| Steve Lee      | 02:35 | Like now for example.                                        |
| Max Danos      | 02:37 | I think that's clear, Steve.                                 |
| Max Danos      | 02:39 | So what do you want me to do?                                |
| Steve Lee      | 02:40 | Okay, so here are your action points.                        |
| Steve Lee      | 02:44 | Cameron.                                                     |
| Steve Lee      | 02:44 | Work on a story for the American media.                      |
| Steve Lee      | 02:47 | Don't do anything with it yet.                               |
| Steve Lee      | 02:49 | Wait to see if anything comes out about the Chichon business. |
| Steve Lee      | 02:52 | Watch all the newspaper websites, news blogs, news agency sites, everything you can find. |
| Steve Lee      | 02:57 | Let me know as soon as you see anything.                     |
| Cameron Diallo | 03:00 | Sure.                                                        |
| Steve Lee      | 03:00 | Max, I want you to go to Chichon immediately.                |
| Steve Lee      | 03:03 | See what's going on with their quality control procedures.   |
| Steve Lee      | 03:06 | If you need to fire anybody, fire them right away.           |
| Steve Lee      | 03:10 | And while you're in Central America, take a look at some of our other plants. |
| Steve Lee      | 03:13 | We can't have this happening again, ever.                    |
| Steve Lee      | 03:16 | This has top priority.                                       |
| Steve Lee      | 03:17 | Okay?                                                        |
| Steve Lee      | 03:18 | Leave everything else you're doing at the moment and concentrate on this. |
| Cameron Diallo | 03:22 | I'll go and get on it right away.                            |
| Max Danos      | 03:24 | I'll be in Chichon by tomorrow morning.                      |
| Paola          | 03:30 | Hello.                                                       |
| Paola          | 03:30 | Mr. Danos?                                                   |
| Max Danos      | 03:31 | Yes.                                                         |
| Paola          | 03:32 | I'm Paola, the secretary of Alfredo Marron.                  |
| Paola          | 03:35 | Did you have a pleasant flight?                              |
| Max Danos      | 03:37 | Yes.                                                         |
| Paola          | 03:38 | I'll take you to your hotel first.                           |
| Paola          | 03:40 | You can have a shower and relax.                             |
| Paola          | 03:42 | If you like, I can take you for a walk around our beautiful Chichon city. |
| Paola          | 03:46 | Is it your first time?                                       |
| Max Danos      | 03:47 | There's no time for that.                                    |
| Max Danos      | 03:49 | Just take me straight to the office, please.                 |
| Paola          | 03:50 | Oh, okay, no problem.                                        |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:01 | Max.                                                         |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:01 | Hello.                                                       |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:02 | Did you have a good flight?                                  |
| Max Danos      | 04:03 | Yes, yes, yes.                                               |
| Max Danos      | 04:04 | So what's going on?                                          |
| Max Danos      | 04:05 | What have you found out since we last spoke?                 |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:07 | I have some very good news for you.                          |
| Max Danos      | 04:10 | Oh yes, I got all the bottles back.                          |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:12 | And they weren't contaminated?                               |
| Max Danos      | 04:14 | No?                                                          |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:15 | No! That's why quality control didn't find a problem because there wasn't one. |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:21 | And there's another piece of good news.                      |
| Max Danos      | 04:23 | What's that?                                                 |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:24 | The president of Chichon resigned yesterday.                 |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:28 | Not so good for the country maybe, but great news for us.    |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:32 | Of course, the newspapers have completely forgotten about our little problem. |
| Max Danos      | 04:37 | Okay, well, I still want to take a very good look at your quality control procedures. |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:42 | Of course, be my guest.                                      |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:44 | And please let me invite you to dinner.                      |
| Alfredo Marron | 04:47 | You must try some of our famous Chichon specialties.         |
| Steve Lee      | 04:56 | So that's it.                                                |
| Steve Lee      | 04:57 | Hey Max, next time this happens.                             |
| Max Danos      | 04:59 | There isn't going to be a next time.                         |
| Steve Lee      | 05:01 | I said next time this happens.                               |
| Steve Lee      | 05:04 | Wait to see if there's a fire before you call the fire department. |
| Max Danos      | 05:08 | This looked like a very serious situation.                   |
| Steve Lee      | 05:10 | Yeah, it looked like one, but it wasn't.                     |
| Max Danos      | 05:14 | Okay, thanks, Steve.                                         |
| Max Danos      | 05:15 | Do you have anything else for me?                            |
| Steve Lee      | 05:17 | No.                                                          |
| Max Danos      | 05:18 | Then I'll go back to work on the quality control program, if that's all right by you. |
| Steve Lee      | 05:24 | Of course.                                                   |
| Steve Lee      | 05:25 | Off you go.                                                  |
