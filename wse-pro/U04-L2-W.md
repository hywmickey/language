Steve says that the compay needs to save money.
Max says people should see what pens they have before they order more.
Max wants everyone to find five examples of waste in their departments.
Steve wants everyone to get better prices from their suppliers.
Wanda says that companies can save money in other ways.
Alice doesn't think delivery dates and colors of the folders are important.
Sunil thinks that contracts are better than emails for a business deal.
Dary1 agrees to reduce the price on the computers.
Steve thinks everybody should do what Sunil did to get lower prices.
```

```
# speak
Max is going to speak about how we can improve some of our procedures.
We're ordering stuff we don't need; 
we're ordering more expensive products instead of cheaper ones.
Wasting money is dumb. Saving money is smart.
People are ordering things without checking if we have them already.
We're not getting the best prices from our suppliers.
We're not pressing them hard enough.
Take highlighting pens, for example.
People are ordering sets of pens instead of individual pens.
```

```
# test
Have you improved your ordering procedures? - No. We are having a meeting today to come up with new ideas.
Is the Marketing Department ordering supplies they don't need? - Yes. I don't think they check their old supplies before they order new ones.
Why don't they check their supplies? - The assistant said they are too busy to check, but they are spending too much money.
Should we order cheaper supplies? - Yes. We need to save money.
Is it cheaper to order individual pencils or sets? - I'm not sure. You need to check with the supplier. 
```

```
# speak
Can't you do better than that?
We have to find ways of saving money.
A dollar saved is a dollar earned.
We're always bought folders from you, but we are looking at other suppliers.
Office Discount is a bit cheaper than us, but we offer better value for the money.
We deliver in two days, they deliver in a week.
Our folders are better quality than theirs.
I can't see any difference in quality.
My CEO isn't happy with these prices.
He told me to get you to reduce your prices.
I'll take $30 off the laptops and $20 off the desktops. # $发音省略
OK, you win.
I'll give you 10% off the list price.
```

```
# test
I need you to do better than 10 percent off.
I don't want to pay more for laptops.
He wants you to reduce your prices.
If you don't lower your prices, I'll need to look at other suppliers.
We have to find ways to save money.
Power Inc. took 50% off each computer.
New Tech gave me 20 percent off the original price.
```

```
# test
One way to save money is to go on fewer business trips.
We waste a lot of money on traveling; we can have more conference calls.
We can also order fewer suppliers; we buy a lot that we don't need.
I forgot to check to see if we had paper, and I ordered too much.
We are meeting with our expensive suppliers to ask them to lower their prices.
My boss said I need to press our supliers more, but I don't like to do that.
My parents always said, "A penny saved is a penny earned".
```

```
# test
I'd like to look at a new supplier in Tianjin.
This supplier is cheaper, but they are always late with deliveries.
They offer better value for the same money.
How quickly can they deliver these pens?
I was surprised when my boss said the old products are better than the new ones.
There is a big difference in quality, so I don't think we should use them.
```

```
# speak
We agreed on the price for those computers.
We said $900 for the laptops and $500 for the desktops. # $发音省略
It was in an email on April 20th.
You replied the day after saying, "accepted - Sunil".
You accepted the price in writing.
That means you can't change it now.
An email isn't a contract.
```

```
# test
Our companies agreed on the price, so you can't change it.
What did we say for the new telephones?
Mr. James sent an email, so you have the price in writing.
He also sent a contract the day after he sent the email.
We didn't change the price in the contract.
I hope you accept the price so we can work together.
```

```
# test
I was wondering if you could do better on these paper prices.
But I've already taken off 8 percent.
Then we'll have to look at other suppliers.
OK, you win. I'll give you another 2 percent off the list price.
My boss isn't happy with the prices on pens either.
Really? I think the prices on the pens are good.
She told me to get you to reduce those prices, too.
OK, I'll take twenty cents off each set.
That's great. Thanks.
You're welcome. Do you think that will do?
I think so. I'll check with my office.
```

```
# test
I've already taken off as much as I can.
Last year, you gave us a great deal on cell phones.
Everybody wants to save money.
Wait a minute. We already agreed on those prices.
I know the other supplier is cheaper, but we have the best customer relations.
You accepted this price last week, so you can't change it now.
I'll give you a $50 discount; will that do?
That's the best we can do.
```

| Luara | 00:00 | Well, here I am, Max.                                        |
| Luara | 00:01 | What did you want to talk about?                             |
| Max   | 00:04 | I wanted to talk about cutting waste and saving money.       |
| Luara | 00:08 | Well, I'm sure we all want to do that.                       |
| Luara | 00:10 | What exactly did you have in mind?                           |
| Max   | 00:13 | Well, I'm asking all managers to reduce waste in their departments. |
| Luara | 00:18 | That's great, Max, but I don't think you'll find much waste in mine. |
| Max   | 00:24 | I don't agree.                                               |
| Max   | 00:26 | When I looked, I found plenty of waste in your department.   |
| Luara | 00:30 | Really?                                                      |
| Luara | 00:31 | Could you give me some examples?                             |
| Max   | 00:34 | Sure.                                                        |
| Max   | 00:35 | You ordered your office supplies from Office Friend instead of Office Discount. |
| Luara | 00:41 | Is there a big difference?                                   |
| Max   | 00:44 | Of course.                                                   |
| Max   | 00:45 | Office discount is 15% cheaper.                              |
| Luara | 00:49 | Okay, I'll order from them in the future.                    |
| Luara | 00:52 | Anything else?                                               |
| Max   | 00:54 | Yes.                                                         |
| Max   | 00:55 | You print your documents on one side of the paper only.      |
| Luara | 00:59 | Well, that's the way they come out of the printer.           |
| Max   | 01:03 | You can change the settings on your computer to print on both sides of the paper. |
| Luara | 01:08 | Sorry, I don't know how to do that.                          |
| Max   | 01:12 | Ask someone from IT to help you.                             |
| Luara | 01:15 | Okay.                                                        |
| Luara | 01:16 | Is there anything else you'd like me to do?                  |
| Max   | 01:20 | Yes, you should ask all your suppliers to reduce their prices. |
| Luara | 01:24 | All of them?                                                 |
| Max   | 01:25 | Yes, all of them.                                            |
| Luara | 01:29 | All right, I'll try.                                         |
| Luara | 01:32 | Do you want me to send you a report about this?              |
| Max   | 01:36 | Yes, Send me a report at the end of the month showing what you've saved and how. |
| Luara | 01:42 | Okay, I'll do my best, Max.                                  |
| Max   | 01:46 | Thank you.                                                   |

| Alice | 00:11 | I'd like to order some folders, please.                      |
| Wanda | 00:14 | Okay, your normal order.                                     |
| Alice | 00:17 | No, I want five sets of folders instead of four.             |

| Wanda | 00:30 | Is that okay?                                                |

| Alice | 00:34 | I'm asking for 10%.                                          |

| Wanda | 00:42 | And you're only ordering five sets of folders.               |
| Alice | 00:46 | I can always talk to other suppliers.                        |
| Alice | 00:48 | You know, like office discount.                              |
| Wanda | 00:52 | Office discount may be cheaper than us, but we offer better value for the money. |
| Alice | 00:58 | In what way?                                                 |

# test
We ordered the folders at 20 cents each.
Make sure you get the cheap ones instead of the expensive ones.
I can reduce the price by 10 dollares.
I want to add one more point about saving money.
I'm working with three different suppliers to order the furniture.
I can take off another two percent.
These computers are a much better value than those.
The list price of the TV is too high.
I need you to give me a discount on my order.
OK, I'll accept that price; I think it's fair.
Can you deliver the new chairs by Tuesday?

# test
We need to stop wasting money.
We are spending way too much on our supplies, and it has to stop.
A dollar saved is a dollar earned.
Can't you do any better than that?
You're getting a great deal.
We'll pay the full price; OK, you win.
I'm sorry. That's the best I can do.
Saving is smart. It's as simple as that.
We really need to keep prices down.
We offer great value for the money.
But you accept our price in writing!
I'll give you fifteen percent off the list price.
