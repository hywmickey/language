| Cameron | 00:04 | It's about the emails you've sent today.                     |
| Alice   | 00:06 | Oh dear.                                                     |
| Alice   | 00:07 | I'm sorry, is there a problem?                               |
| Cameron | 00:09 | Yes, there is.                                               |
| Cameron | 00:11 | One of them is much too informal and the other one is much too formal. |
| Alice   | 00:16 | I'm sorry, could you give me some more detail, please?       |
| Cameron | 00:19 | Yes.                                                         |
| Cameron | 00:20 | The email you sent to Ken Johnson was much too informal.     |
| Alice   | 00:24 | Could you give me some examples of what you mean, please?    |
| Cameron | 00:28 | For example, you wrote catch you later to Ken.               |
| Alice   | 00:32 | What should I say instead?                                   |
| Cameron | 00:34 | In a formal email like this, you should say regards at the end. |
| Alice   | 00:39 | Thanks, Cameron.                                             |
| Alice   | 00:40 | I'll go back and correct it.                                 |
| Alice   | 00:41 | Is there anything else?                                      |
| Cameron | 00:43 | Yes.                                                         |

| Cameron | 00:47 | You work in the same office.                                 |
| Cameron | 00:50 | It's okay to be more informal with him.                      |
| Cameron | 00:53 | Also, he's much younger than Ken.                            |
| Alice   | 00:56 | Perhaps you could explain when to be formal and when to be informal. |
| Cameron | 01:00 | It's simple.                                                 |

| Alice   | 01:14 | Thanks a lot.                                                |
| Alice   | 01:16 | Well, I'll go and correct those two emails now.              |
| Cameron | 01:19 | One other thing.                                             |
| Cameron | 01:20 | I deleted the other email you sent me.                       |
| Cameron | 01:23 | The one to your friend.                                      |
| Alice   | 01:24 | I'm so sorry about that, Cameron.                            |
| Alice   | 01:26 | It'll never happen again.                                    |
| Cameron | 01:28 | I hope not.                                                  |
| Cameron | 01:30 | Please don't email or text your friends when you are at work. |
| Alice   | 01:34 | Oh no, I won't.                                              |
| Alice   | 01:35 | Never again.                                                 |
