| Cameron         | 01:15 | Okay, the goal of this meeting, as you know, is to talk about the new marketing plan. | 好了，大家都知道，本次会议的目的是讨论新的营销计划。         |
| Cameron         | 01:20 | Well, you know what?                                         | 不过，跟大家说件事。                                         |
| Cameron         | 01:22 | There is no marketing plan.                                  | 其实根本没有什么新营销计划。                                 |
| Cameron         | 01:23 | I don't have one.                                            | 我压根就没制定。                                             |
| Cameron         | 01:25 | And the reason is that we don't have the information.        | 原因就是我们没有足够的信息支撑。                             |
| Cameron         | 01:31 | This company has almost no information about its customers.  | 我们公司几乎没有任何关于客户的信息。                         |
| Cameron         | 01:35 | All we know is that our market share has gone down.          | 我们只知道市场份额一直在下滑。                               |
| Cameron         | 01:38 | In 1990, we had 8% of the United States soft drinks market.  | 1990年，我们占据了美国软饮市场8%的份额。                     |
| Cameron         | 01:43 | In 2000 we had 6.5%.                                         | 2000年，这个比例降到了6.5%。                                |
| Cameron         | 01:46 | And last year we had 4.6%.                                   | 而去年，我们只有4.6%的份额。                                |
| Cameron         | 01:49 | But we don't know why it keeps going down.                   | 但我们始终不知道销量下滑的原因。                             |
| Bob             | 01:52 | Sorry.                                                       | 抱歉打断一下。                                               |
| Bob             | 01:52 | But we do know why.                                          | 但我们其实知道原因。                                         |
| Bob             | 01:54 | It's because we don't have enough salespeople.               | 问题出在我们的销售人员人手不足。                             |
| Bob             | 01:57 | We keep firing them.                                         | 我们还一直在裁员。                                           |
| Cameron         | 01:58 | Thanks Bob, but I'd just like to finish what I have to say first and then we can discuss all the points together afterwards. | 谢谢你，鲍勃，但我想先把我的话讲完，之后我们再一起讨论所有问题。 |
| Cameron         | 02:06 | Does that work for you?                                      | 你觉得这样可以吗？                                           |
| Bob             | 02:08 | Whatever you say.                                            | 你说了算。                                                   |
| Cameron         | 02:10 | So we're losing market share year on year.                   | 所以我们的市场份额年复一年地在流失。                         |
| Cameron         | 02:12 | Now we may all have our ideas about why that is, but we don't have any hard information. | 或许每个人都有自己的猜测，但我们没有任何确凿的信息来佐证。   |
| Cameron         | 02:18 | So we're going to hire a market research agency to do a study of our market and our customers. | 所以我们打算聘请一家市场调研机构，来研究我们的市场和客户情况。 |
| Bob             | 02:25 | Isn't that Dominic's job?                                    | 这难道不是多米尼克的工作吗？                                 |
| Bob             | 02:26 | How much more market research do we need?                    | 我们到底还需要多少市场调研？                                 |
| Cameron         | 02:30 | Dominic is doing a great job, but there's just too much for him to do by himself. | 多米尼克工作做得很棒，但这些工作单凭他一个人实在难以完成。   |
| Laura           | 02:36 | May I ask a question, please?                                | 请问我能提个问题吗？                                         |
| Laura           | 02:38 | How much is all this going to cost?                          | 这一切要花费多少钱？                                         |
| Laura           | 02:40 | I mean, we don't even have a budget for market research.     | 我的意思是，我们甚至没有市场调研的预算。                     |
| Laura           | 02:43 | Except for Dominic.                                          | 除了多米尼克的相关开支之外。                                 |
| Cameron         | 02:44 | It's okay.                                                   | 没关系的。                                                   |
| Cameron         | 02:45 | Steve has already approved the budget.                       | 史蒂夫已经批准了这笔预算。                                   |
| Laura           | 02:47 | Oh, has he?                                                  | 哦，他批准了？                                               |
| Laura           | 02:48 | Well, he hasn't told me about it.                            | 可他压根没跟我说过这事。                                     |
| Cameron         | 02:50 | Well, I'm sure he'll talk to you about it when he Comes back. | 我相信他回来后会跟你谈的。                                   |
| Cameron         | 02:53 | So I'm looking at two market research firms.                 | 目前我在考察两家市场调研公司。                               |
| Cameron         | 02:56 | One local firm from L. A and one from New York.              | 一家是洛杉矶的本地公司，另一家来自纽约。                     |
| Cameron         | 02:59 | I'm going to ask them to come here and tell us some of their ideas. | 我打算请他们过来，给我们讲讲他们的调研思路。                 |
| Cameron         | 03:02 | But first we need to tell them what we're looking for.       | 但首先我们得告诉他们我们想要调研哪些内容。                   |
| Dominic         | 03:06 | Well, I think we need to know what our old customers are drinking now. | 我认为我们需要了解老客户现在都在喝什么饮品。                 |
| Bob             | 03:10 | Who cares what they're drinking now?                         | 谁在乎他们现在喝什么？                                       |
| Bob             | 03:12 | They're not drinking our product.                            | 反正他们不喝我们的产品。                                     |
| Bob             | 03:14 | That's what matters.                                         | 这才是关键。                                                 |
| Cameron         | 03:15 | Good point.                                                  | 说得有道理。                                                 |
| Cameron         | 03:16 | Thanks, Dominic.                                             | 谢谢你，多米尼克。                                           |
| Cameron         | 03:17 | Any other ideas?                                             | 还有其他想法吗？                                             |
| Alice           | 03:19 | Well, I think we need to know what people think of BerryAde. | 我觉得我们需要了解大家对贝里艾德（饮品）的看法。             |
| Alice           | 03:23 | I think we need to look at three groups of people.           | 我认为我们需要调研三类人群。                                 |
| Alice           | 03:26 | The ones who still drink BerryAde, the ones who drank it before but don't drink it now. | 一类是仍在饮用贝里艾德的人，一类是曾经喝过但现在不喝的人。   |
| Alice           | 03:31 | And the ones who have never drunk it.                        | 还有一类是从未喝过这款饮品的人。                             |
| Cameron         | 03:34 | Yeah, great idea, Alice.                                     | 没错，爱丽丝，这个想法很棒。                                 |
| Cameron         | 03:35 | Anyone else?                                                 | 还有其他人有想法吗？                                         |
| Cameron         | 03:37 | Max, any thoughts?                                           | 马克斯，你有什么想法吗？                                     |
| Max             | 03:39 | I approve.                                                   | 我同意。                                                     |
| Max             | 03:40 | We don't have enough information about our business.         | 我们对自己的业务确实缺乏足够的了解。                         |
| Cameron         | 03:42 | Right.                                                       | 没错。                                                       |

| Cameron         | 03:44 | So, anyone else?                                             | 那还有其他人要发言吗？                                       |
| Bob             | 03:46 | Well, you know what I think.                                 | 哼，你们都知道我的想法。                                     |
| Bob             | 03:47 | We can get all the market information we need from our salespeople. | 我们需要的所有市场信息都可以从销售人员那里获取。             |
| Bob             | 03:52 | They're out there in the market every day talking to customers. | 他们每天都在市场上和客户打交道。                             |
| Bob             | 03:56 | But we're gonna hire some guys from New York who know nothing about our product or our market. | 可我们却要雇一群纽约来的人，他们对我们的产品和市场一无所知。 |
| Bob             | 04:01 | And pay them a ton of money.                                 | 还要付给他们一大笔钱。                                       |
| Bob             | 04:03 | It's just plain crazy.                                       | 这简直是疯了。                                               |
| Cameron         | 04:05 | We have had this conversation before, Bob, but I'll answer your points again. | 鲍勃，这个问题我们之前讨论过，但我还是再回应一下你的观点。   |
| Cameron         | 04:10 | First point, with lower sales, we don't need so many salespeople. And the .... | 第一，销量下滑，我们就不需要那么多销售人员了。而且……         |
| Bob             | 04:15 | That's why we have lower sales, because we don't have enough salespeople. | 销量下滑就是因为销售人员不够！                               |
| Cameron         | 04:20 | And the second point is salespeople and market research experts have completely different skills. | 第二，销售人员和市场调研专家所具备的技能完全不同。           |
| Cameron         | 04:27 | When you need market research information, you have to go to experts. | 当你需要市场调研信息时，就该找专业的调研人员。               |
| Cameron         | 04:32 | Sorry.                                                       | 抱歉。                                                       |
| Cameron         | 04:33 | Well, that's all we have time for.                           | 好了，我们的时间差不多到了。                                 |
| Cameron         | 04:35 | Thank you again for coming.                                  | 再次感谢大家的到来。                                         |
| Cameron         | 04:36 | I'll let you know about the market research meeting. Yes, Bob. | 关于市场调研会议的安排，我后续会通知大家。鲍勃，你还有事？   |
| Bob             | 04:39 | I have something else to say.                                | 我还有别的事要说。                                           |
| Bob             | 04:41 | I have a new sales plan which I'd like to talk about.        | 我制定了一份新的销售计划，想跟大家聊聊。                     |
| Cameron         | 04:44 | Oh, really?                                                  | 哦，是吗？                                                   |
| Cameron         | 04:46 | Well, I'm sorry.                                             | 实在不好意思。                                               |
| Cameron         | 04:47 | I have a 10 o' clock meeting, so I have to go.               | 我十点还有个会，得先走了。                                   |
| Cameron         | 04:49 | But if the others can stay.                                  | 不过如果其他人能留下来的话。                                 |
| Dominic         | 04:52 | Of course, with pleasure.                                    | 当然可以，我们很乐意。                                       |
| Max             | 04:55 | I have 35 minutes before my next meeting.                    | 我距离下一场会议还有35分钟时间。                             |
| Cameron         | 04:58 | Okay.                                                        | 好的。                                                       |
| Cameron         | 04:59 | Then Alice can report back to me later.                      | 那之后由爱丽丝向我汇报后续情况。                             |
| Cameron         | 05:01 | So, once again, thank you everyone.                          | 那么，再次感谢大家。                                         |
| Cameron         | 05:03 | See you later.                                               | 回头见。                                                     |

| Bob             | 05:08 | And I found something very interesting.                      | 而且发现了一些很有意思的情况。                               |
| Bob             | 05:11 | If you look at small stores, not big supermarkets, our product is in only 8% of them. | 你们看那些小商店，不是大型超市，我们的产品只进入了其中8%的门店。 |
| Bob             | 05:18 | And the reason is that we don't have enough salespeople.     | 原因就是我们的销售人员不够。                                 |
| Cameron         | 05:23 | Hello, Alice.                                                | 你好，爱丽丝。                                               |

| Cameron         | 05:28 | Please don't write things like Bob was angry.                | 请不要写诸如“鲍勃很生气”这类内容。                           |
| Cameron         | 05:32 | Just write down what people said.                            | 只需要记录下大家说的话就行。                                 |

| Cameron         | 05:35 | And you didn't say much about Bob's sales plan or anything that happened after I left. | 而且你几乎没记录鲍勃的销售计划，也没提我离开后发生的任何事情。 |
| Alice           | 05:41 | Oh, I guess I didn't think you were very interested in Bob's sales plan or that anyone else was. | 哦，我以为你对鲍勃的销售计划不感兴趣，其他人应该也一样。     |
| Cameron         | 05:47 | Alice, Bob is a senior manager of this company.              | 爱丽丝，鲍勃是公司的高级经理。                               |

| Alice           | 06:00 | I'm sorry.                                                   | 对不起。                                                     |
| Cameron         | 06:01 | It's all right.                                              | 没关系。                                                     |
| Cameron         | 06:02 | Anyway, that's all.                                          | 好了，就说这些吧。                                           |

| Cameron         | 06:07 | Well done.                                                   | 做得很好。                                                   |
| Alice           | 06:08 | Thank you.                                                   | 谢谢。                                                       |
