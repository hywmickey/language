| Cameron | 00:04 | Hi Alice.                                                    |
| Cameron | 00:05 | Did you book the conference room.                            |
| Alice   | 00:07 | For the sales and marketing meeting?                         |
| Alice   | 00:09 | Yes, no problem.                                             |
| Alice   | 00:10 | But there is one thing.                                      |
| Cameron | 00:12 | What's that?                                                 |
| Alice   | 00:13 | Well, you asked me to call everybody who's coming, but why don't I just send everyone an invitation using Outlook? |
| Alice   | 00:20 | It'll save a lot of time.                                    |
| Cameron | 00:22 | I have heard of Outlook.                                     |
| Cameron | 00:24 | Alice, the meeting's in two days and I want to be sure that everyone comes. |
| Cameron | 00:28 | So go and call them now, please.                             |
| Alice   | 00:30 | Of course.                                                   |
| Alice   | 00:31 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Cameron | 00:32 | It's all right.                                              |
| Cameron | 00:33 | But send them an Outlook invitation as a reminder.           |
| Cameron | 00:36 | Okay.                                                        |
| Alice   | 00:43 | Uh, hello, Is this Steve?                                    |
| Steve   | 00:45 | Yeah.                                                        |
| Steve   | 00:46 | This is Alice, right?                                        |
| Steve   | 00:47 | Is this about the marketing meeting?                         |
| Alice   | 00:49 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alice   | 00:49 | I was wondering if you.                                      |
| Steve   | 00:50 | It's okay.                                                   |
| Steve   | 00:51 | Cameron already told me about it.                            |
| Steve   | 00:52 | It's in my diary.                                            |
| Steve   | 00:53 | Talk to you later, Alice.                                    |
| Alice   | 00:55 | Never mind.                                                  |
| Alice   | 00:56 | On we go.                                                    |
| Alice   | 00:58 | Max Danos.                                                   |
| Alice   | 01:02 | Excuse me.                                                   |
| Alice   | 01:03 | Dominic.                                                     |
| Dominic | 01:03 | Alice.                                                       |
| Dominic | 01:05 | How can I help you?                                          |
| Alice   | 01:06 | I just wondered, do you know if Max is in the office this week or is he traveling? |
| Dominic | 01:11 | You mean our beloved coo?                                    |
| Alice   | 01:13 | He's the coo, is he?                                         |
| Alice   | 01:15 | I thought he was something to do with it.                    |
| Dominic | 01:18 | No, no, no.                                                  |
| Dominic | 01:19 | You're thinking of Sunil.                                    |
| Dominic | 01:20 | Sunil Gupta.                                                 |
| Dominic | 01:21 | He's the head of IT.                                         |
| Dominic | 01:23 | The company's organization chart.                            |
| Dominic | 01:25 | Alice.                                                       |
| Dominic | 01:26 | Take it home, read it in bed.                                |
| Alice   | 01:29 | I have read it.                                              |
| Alice   | 01:30 | I just forgot some of the details, that's all.               |
| Alice   | 01:34 | Anyway, do you know if Max is in this week?                  |
| Dominic | 01:38 | Why don't you go over and ask him?                           |
| Alice   | 01:46 | Excuse me.                                                   |
| Max     | 01:47 | Come in.                                                     |
| Alice   | 01:48 | Uh, I'm Alice Pettit, Cameron Diallo's assistant.            |
| Max     | 01:52 | Uh huh.                                                      |
| Max     | 01:53 | I've seen you around.                                        |
| Max     | 01:54 | Max Danos, Chief Operating Officer.                          |
| Max     | 01:57 | What can I do for you?                                       |
| Alice   | 01:58 | Well, there's a meeting on Thursday morning at 9 am to talk about the new marketing plan. |
| Max     | 02:04 | Really?                                                      |
| Max     | 02:05 | I've seen nothing about it.                                  |
| Alice   | 02:06 | No, Cameron has just set it up and she wanted to be sure that everyone could come. |
| Max     | 02:11 | Well, she's not giving us much notice.                       |
| Max     | 02:14 | Let me check my diary.                                       |
| Max     | 02:16 | How long is it?                                              |
| Max     | 02:17 | I've got another meeting at 11:30.                           |
| Alice   | 02:19 | That'll be no problem.                                       |
| Alice   | 02:20 | It won't last longer than an hour and a half.                |
| Max     | 02:23 | Okay, send me an invitation please, along with the agenda.   |
| Alice   | 02:26 | Yes, of course.                                              |
| Alice   | 02:28 | Thanks a lot, Max.                                           |
| Max     | 02:30 | You can leave the door open.                                 |
| Alice   | 02:33 | I need a coffee.                                             |
| Bob     | 02:40 | Come in.                                                     |
| Bob     | 02:43 | Hello there.                                                 |
| Bob     | 02:44 | You're Cameron's new assistant, aren't you?                  |
| Bob     | 02:46 | Let me see.                                                  |
| Bob     | 02:48 | Alice, am I right?                                           |
| Alice   | 02:49 | That's right.                                                |
| Alice   | 02:50 | Alice Pettit.                                                |
| Bob     | 02:51 | I'm Bob Harrison, VP of Sales, I guess you know.             |
| Bob     | 02:55 | Very pleased to meet you.                                    |
| Alice   | 02:56 | Right, Me too.                                               |
| Alice   | 02:59 | So Cameron's organized a meeting for Thursday at 9 am to talk about the marketing plan and she asked me to make sure that everyone can come. |
| Bob     | 03:07 | That's rather Short notice, isn't it?                        |
| Bob     | 03:09 | I'll have to check my diary.                                 |
| Bob     | 03:12 | 9 am on Thursday?                                            |
| Bob     | 03:15 | No, I can't do that.                                         |
| Bob     | 03:16 | I'm in Phoenix the whole day.                                |
| Bob     | 03:18 | I can do Friday or next Tuesday at the same time.            |
| Bob     | 03:23 | You'll have to ask her to reschedule.                        |
| Alice   | 03:25 | Yeah, that's right.                                          |
| Alice   | 03:27 | We'll have to reschedule it.                                 |
| Bob     | 03:29 | Then, there's no problem.                                    |
| Alice   | 03:30 | Right.                                                       |
| Alice   | 03:32 | So long, Bob.                                                |
| Cameron | 03:38 | Ah, Alice.                                                   |
| Cameron | 03:39 | Have you sorted everything out for the meeting?              |
| Alice   | 03:41 | Well, there is a bit of ... .                                |
| Cameron | 03:43 | Oh, I forgot to tell you.                                    |
| Cameron | 03:44 | I hope you invited Laura.                                    |
| Alice   | 03:46 | You mean Laura Balin, the cfo?                               |
| Alice   | 03:48 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alice   | 03:49 | You said to invite all the senior managers.                  |
| Alice   | 03:51 | I hope that was all right.                                   |
| Cameron | 03:53 | Yes, I wanted you to.                                        |
| Cameron | 03:55 | She's just the Director of Finance.                          |
| Cameron | 03:57 | By the way, we don't have a CFO yet.                         |
| Alice   | 04:00 | Oh, dear.                                                    |
| Alice   | 04:01 | When I sent the email, I addressed her as the cfo.           |
| Cameron | 04:04 | Well, I'm sure she won't mind.                               |
| Cameron | 04:07 | Come by later to talk about the agenda.                      |
| Cameron | 04:09 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron | 04:09 | I must get on now.                                           |
| Alice   | 04:10 | Sorry, but there is one problem.                             |
| Cameron | 04:12 | Can't it wait?                                               |
| Cameron | 04:13 | I'm really busy right now.                                   |
| Alice   | 04:15 | It's just I think we're going to have to reschedule the meeting. |
| Cameron | 04:18 | Reschedule the meeting?                                      |
| Cameron | 04:20 | Why?                                                         |
| Alice   | 04:21 | Well, Bob isn't available.                                   |
| Alice   | 04:24 | He's out of the office all of Thursday.                      |
| Cameron | 04:26 | I'm sorry, we're just going to have to do it without him.    |
| Cameron | 04:29 | He can join us by conference if he wants to.                 |
| Alice   | 04:31 | Oh, okay, fine.                                              |
| Alice   | 04:34 | I'll get on with it.                                         |
| Cameron | 04:35 | Send him an invitation with the number to call into, Okay?   |
| Alice   | 04:38 | No problem.                                                  |
| Alice   | 04:47 | Oh, Dominic, you're available for the meeting on Thursday, aren't you? |
| Dominic | 04:51 | Sure thing.                                                  |
| Dominic | 04:52 | There's no way I'm going to miss it.                         |
| Dominic | 04:54 | So there's a problem about Bob, is there?                    |
| Alice   | 04:57 | It's just that he can't make the meeting, that's all.        |
| Dominic | 05:00 | And Cameron didn't reschedule?                               |
| Dominic | 05:03 | Bob isn't going to like that at all.                         |
| Alice   | 05:05 | Well, there's nothing we can do about it.                    |
