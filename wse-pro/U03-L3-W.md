# speak
I want to see you working better with your co-workers, especially Alice.
She expects you to be a hundred percent perfect all the time.
A good employee is going to get a lot of 2s, with a few 3s, and no 1s at all.
You've put two, but for me you're three.
It's possible to be too safe.
She expects you to be a hundred percent perfect all the time.
I don't expect you to be one hundred percent perfect one hundred percent of the time.
Ninety-five percent of the time is good enough for me.
对我来说，百分之九十五的表现就足够好了。
结合原文场景（上级 Cameron 安抚员工 Alice，无需追求绝对完美），译文补充 “表现” 二字，使语义更完整，避免 “百分之九十五的时间” 这种字面化误解，贴合职场评估的语境

I want to see you working better with others.
I don't expect you to be perfect all of the time.
A good employee is going to get some low numbers.

This is good enough for me.

# speak
I just got this employee evaluation form.
I don't know how to fill it out.
How do you evaluate yourself, choose 1, 2 or 3?
Give yourself 3 out of 3.
I put three for that.
I only put 2 for that, because I'm not a yes-man.
Does the employee seem to enjoy his or her work?
Does the employee finish his or her work within specifications and on time?
Is the employee willing and able to work with others?
Does the employee always follow instructions?
```

# test
I don't know how to fill out this evaluation form.
How do you evaluate yourself?
Do you try to say only good stuff, or do you talk about problems?
Does the employee seem to enjoy his or her work?
Does the employee finish his or her work?
Is the employee willing and able to work with others?
Does the employee always follow instructions?
```

```
# speak
That's something I'm especially good at.
I get along pretty well with my co-workers.
It's not just about getting along with people; It's about really working together. 
And that's not something you're very good at.
I'm not a yes man. I have my own ideas.
Actually, I think you are something of a yes man.
I feel I can trust you to make the right decisions.
```

```
# test
I get along very well with all the managers.
It's important to do your work within specifications, and that's not something you are especially good at.
I'm also really good at fixing computer problems and making budgets.
I have my own ideas.
I can always trust you to work hard and do a great job.
It's not good to be a yes-man; it means you don't have your own ideas.
Most people in this office work well together; that's why I love my job.
```

```
# test
Choose 1, 2, or 3.
I put 2 out of 3.
Give yourself a 2.
You've put 2 for that.
A good employee is going to get a lot of 2s.
I think you are a 3.
```

```
# test
Lucy expects you to be 100 percent perfect when there are visitors in the office.
Kwan needs to spend 50 percent of his time on this report.
Miguel got 95 percent correct on this test.
Kriston is a great worker. He always gives 100 percent of this time to his projects.
Only 20 percent of the people in my office speak Spanish; I thought almost everyone did!
```

```
# test
"Does the employee finish his/her work within specifications and on time?" - I'll put a 3 here. My work is 100 percent perfect 100 percent of the time.
"Is the employee willing and able to work with others?" - A 3 for this. Getting along with people is something I am especially good at.
"Is the employee good at presenting written ideas and information to others?" - I do this extremely well. I am great at making persentations in important meetings. So, I'll put a 3.
"Is the employee able to use information to make good decisions?" - I'll put a 2 for this. I go to meeting and read reports, but in the end, I do what I want to do.
"Is the employee willing and able to make his/her own decisions when necessary?" - This is a 3. I listen to what other people say, but I always do what I want to do.
"Does the employee always follow instructions?" - I think a 2 for this. I don't do what I am told if I have a better idea. I could do better with this.
"Is the employee always on time for work?" - I'll put a 3 for this. I am at my desk at 8:30 in the morning 99 percent of the time.
"Does the employee seem to enjoy his/her work?" - Maybe a 2; there are some things I really hate, like going to the post office.
"What are the employee's goals and objectives for the time between this and the next review?" - I want to be the Head of the Marketing Department and I want to have my own assistant.
```

```
# test
I've made some changes to your evaluation form.
Really? I spent a lot of time deciding on my answers.
I'm sure you did. Before we go into detail, I want to make some general comments.
I'm sure all of your comments will be very helpful.
My main comment is that I think you need to think about your work and where you could do better.
I thought about that. See, I put a 3 for the question about working with others.
Actually, I don't think you're very good at working with others.
But everyone really likes me!
I'm sure they do, but I think you can do better. Now, let's look at the details.
OK. You know, I didn't put 3 for everything. I have some 2s. I do see places where I can do better.
I didn't see much "I could do better".
So what do you want me to do?
I want you to look at this evaluation again and we can meet again on Monday.
OK. And thanks. I'll try to do better.
```

```
# test
Do you understand the different parts of the evaluation form? - Yes, I do. But I wasn't always sure about the numbers.
I think some of my numbers were to high. - No, there were pretty low.
Well, 3 is the highest number, and you didn't have any 3s. - I think it's hard to evaluate yourself.
I thought it was better to be safe.- It's possible to be too safe.
You are very good at getting along with people, but you only gave yourself a 2. - Everyone here is so nice, so it's easy to get along with them.
It's hard sometimes to do the right thing 100 percent of the time. - I know it is. I'll be happy if it's 95 percent. Nobody's perfect!

| Alice   | 00:16 | What's it for exactly?                                       |
| Dominic | 00:19 | It's for you to evaluate your performance in your job.       |
| Alice   | 00:24 | But how can I evaluate myself?                               |
| Dominic | 00:28 | Would you like to take a look at my form?                    |

| Alice   | 00:34 | Perhaps you could give me some examples.                     |
| Dominic | 00:38 | Ok. Take this question then.                                 |
| Dominic | 00:41 | Does the employee finish his or her work within specifications and on time? |
| Alice   | 00:48 | Right.                                                       |
| Alice   | 00:49 | So what do you have to do?                                   |
| Dominic | 00:52 | You have to choose 1, 2, or 3.                               |
| Alice   | 00:57 | What do they mean exactly?                                   |
| Dominic | 01:00 | 3 means that you always do it.                               |
| Dominic | 01:02 | 2 means that you usually do it, and 1 means that you usually don't do it. |
| Alice   | 01:09 | Okay, I see.                                                 |
| Alice   | 01:11 | So are you going to choose one, two, or three?               |
| Dominic | 01:15 | I'm definitely going to choose three.                        |
| Alice   | 01:18 | Okay.                                                        |
| Alice   | 01:20 | So could you give me another example?                        |
| Dominic | 01:24 | Sure.                                                        |
| Dominic | 01:24 | Let's take this question.                                    |
| Dominic | 01:26 | Does the employee always follow instructions?                |
| Alice   | 01:31 | What did you put for that?                                   |
| Dominic | 01:33 | I put a two.                                                 |
| Dominic | 01:35 | I'm not a yes man.                                           |

| Alice   | 01:41 | So you should be totally honest, right?                      |
| Dominic | 01:44 | That's right.                                                |
| Dominic | 01:45 | Be totally honest.                                           |
| Alice   | 01:48 | Okay.                                                        |
| Alice   | 01:49 | I think I understand how to fill it out now.                 |
| Alice   | 01:51 | Thanks for helping me.                                       |
| Dominic | 01:54 | No problem.                                                  |

| Cameron | 00:01 | I'd like to speak with you about your employee self evaluation form. |
| Dominic | 00:07 | Fine.                                                        |

| Cameron | 00:12 | I've made some changes to it.                                |
| Dominic | 00:16 | Oh dear.                                                     |
| Dominic | 00:17 | What sort of changes?                                        |
| Cameron | 00:20 | I thought that many of your ratings were too high.           |
| Dominic | 00:24 | Sorry, what do you mean exactly?                             |
| Cameron | 00:28 | I mean that you evaluated yourself more highly than I evaluate you. |
| Dominic | 00:36 | Oh, I'm sorry.                                               |
| Dominic | 00:38 | Could you give me an example please?                         |
| Cameron | 00:41 | Certainly.                                                   |
| Cameron | 00:42 | Take this question.                                          |
| Cameron | 00:44 | Is the employee willing and able to work with others?        |
| Cameron | 00:48 | You put a three for that?                                    |
| Dominic | 00:52 | Well, I think I get along pretty well with my co workers.    |
| Cameron | 00:57 | I don't agree Dominic.                                       |
| Cameron | 00:59 | I think you need to do better in that area.                  |
| Dominic | 01:03 | Ok, Cameron, Was that all then?                              |
| Cameron | 01:07 | No, it wasn't.                                               |
| Cameron | 01:09 | Look at this question.                                       |
| Cameron | 01:11 | Is the employee always on time for work?                     |
| Cameron | 01:15 | You also put a three.                                        |
| Dominic | 01:18 | Well, I'm usually on time, give or take a few minutes.       |
| Cameron | 01:23 | That simply isn't true.                                      |
| Cameron | 01:26 | You usually come in 10 to 20 minutes late.                   |
| Dominic | 01:31 | I'm sorry Cameron.                                           |
| Dominic | 01:33 | What do you want me to do?                                   |
| Cameron | 01:36 | I want you to look at the forum again and change your ratings. |
| Cameron | 01:40 | Be totally honest this time.                                 |
| Dominic | 01:44 | Sure.                                                        |
| Dominic | 01:44 | I'll look at it again and email it to you.                   |
| Dominic | 01:47 | Sorry.                                                       |

| Cameron | 00:00 | Alice, I want to talk to you about your employee self evaluation form. |
| Alice   | 00:06 | Oh, yes, I'm sorry.                                          |
| Alice   | 00:08 | I had a bit of trouble filling it out.                       |
| Cameron | 00:11 | What was your problem with it?                               |
| Alice   | 00:15 | Well, I find it very hard to evaluate myself honestly.       |
| Cameron | 00:20 | It's not easy.                                               |
| Cameron | 00:21 | I know.                                                      |
| Alice   | 00:24 | So I probably rated myself much too high.                    |
| Alice   | 00:27 | I'm really sorry.                                            |
| Cameron | 00:29 | No, Alice, that wasn't the problem.                          |
| Cameron | 00:32 | It was the opposite.                                         |
| Cameron | 00:33 | You rated yourself too low.                                  |
| Alice   | 00:37 | Did I really?                                                |
| Alice   | 00:38 | Could you give me an example, please?                        |
| Cameron | 00:42 | Sure.                                                        |
| Cameron | 00:43 | Take this question.                                          |
| Cameron | 00:44 | Is the employee able to use information to make good decisions? |
| Cameron | 00:49 | You put two, but for me you're three.                        |
| Alice   | 00:54 | Do you really think so?                                      |
| Cameron | 00:57 | Yes, I do.                                                   |
| Cameron | 00:58 | I feel I can trust you to make the right decisions.          |
| Alice   | 01:02 | Oh, thanks a lot.                                            |
| Cameron | 01:05 | In fact, your performance is pretty good all around.         |
| Alice   | 01:10 | Well, thank you so much.                                     |
| Alice   | 01:12 | Cameron.                                                     |
| Alice   | 01:13 | Do you want me to change anything in my form?                |
| Cameron | 01:16 | Yes, I'd like you to fill it out again.                      |
| Cameron | 01:19 | And this time don't be so hard on yourself.                  |
| Alice   | 01:24 | Okay, I'll do it right away and email it to you.             |

There are 50 employees at the company.
Rachel gets along well with her co-workers.
She is going to meet with her boss about her evaluation form.
She needs to fill out the form by tomorrow.
It's not easy to evaluate yourself.
You need to think about your performance and how you could do better.
Ms. Lim thinks Rachel is very good at following instructions.
