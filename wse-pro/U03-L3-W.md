I want to see you working better with your co-workers, especially Alice.
She expects you to be a hundred percent perfect all the time.
A good employee is going to get a lot of 2s, with a few 3s, and no 1s at all.
You've put two, but for me you're three.
It's possible to be too safe.
She expects you to be a hundred percent perfect all the time.
I don't expect you to be one hundred percent perfect one hundred percent of the time.
Ninety-five percent of the time is good enough for me.
对我来说，百分之九十五的表现就足够好了。
结合原文场景（上级 Cameron 安抚员工 Alice，无需追求绝对完美），译文补充 “表现” 二字，使语义更完整，避免 “百分之九十五的时间” 这种字面化误解，贴合职场评估的语境

I just got this employee evaluation form.
I don't know how to fill it out.
How do you evaluate yourself, choose 1, 2 or 3?
Give yourself 3 out of 3.
I put three for that.
I only put 2 for that, because I'm not a yes-man.
Does the employee seem to enjoy his or her work?
Does the employee finish his or her work within specifications and on time?
Is the employee willing and able to work with others?
Does the employee always follow instructions?

That's something I'm especially good at.
I get along pretty well with my co-workers.
It's not just about getting along with people; It's about really working together. 
And that's not something you're very good at.
I'm not a yes man. I have my own ideas.
Actually, I think you are something of a yes man.
I feel I can trust you to make the right decisions.

I get along very well with all the managers.
It's important to do your work within specifications, and that's not something you are especially good at.
I'm also really good at fixing computer problems and making budgets.
I have my own ideas.
I can always trust you to work hard and do a great job.
It's not good to be a yes-man; it means you don't have your own ideas.
Most people in this office work well together; that's why I love my job.
