| Cameron   | 00:00 | So did you get through to Marina Rinaldi?                    |
| Alice     | 00:02 | Yes, but it really wasn't easy.                              |
| Alice     | 00:04 | First I called her office, then her work cell phone, then her home, then her private cell. |
| Alice     | 00:09 | I put her down for Tuesday the 23rd at 12 noon with possible lunch. |
| Cameron   | 00:14 | Good.                                                        |
| Cameron   | 00:14 | But you're going to have to change her.                      |
| Alice     | 00:16 | What?                                                        |
| Alice     | 00:18 | Sorry, why?                                                  |
| Cameron   | 00:19 | I'm going to be away for about 10 days from the 20th through the 29th. |
| Alice     | 00:24 | Oh, okay.                                                    |
| Alice     | 00:26 | So do you want me to reorganize your diary and your appointments? |
| Cameron   | 00:29 | Not all of them.                                             |
| Cameron   | 00:30 | Put them into three groups, starting with the ones that aren't important. |
| Cameron   | 00:33 | Those you can just cancel, then rebook the ones which aren't so important for when I'm back, and I'll do the others by conference call, if possible. |
| Cameron   | 00:41 | Except for the really important ones, the people I have to see face to face. |
| Cameron   | 00:45 | Like Marina Rinaldi.                                         |
| Cameron   | 00:47 | Those ones you'll have to rebook for the week after I come back. |
| Cameron   | 00:52 | Was there anything else?                                     |
| Alice     | 00:53 | Well, yes.                                                   |
| Alice     | 00:55 | May I ask where you're going to be so I know what the time difference is for the conference calls? |
| Cameron   | 01:01 | I'll be in Europe, Paris mostly. Nine hours, time difference. |
| Alice     | 01:05 | Okay, great.                                                 |
| Cameron   | 01:07 | Are you all right, Alice?                                    |
| Alice     | 01:09 | No, I'm just. Look, if I'm not sure what to do about some of these appointments, can I get back to you? |
| Cameron   | 01:18 | Oh, I guess so, but try not to have a lot going on.          |
| Alice     | 01:26 | No. Diallo. D, I, A, L, L, O. Cameron Diallo.                |
| Assistant | 01:32 | Will you hold, please? Ms. Diallo?                           |
| Alice     | 01:34 | I'm not Ms. Diallo. I'm her assistant, Alice Pettit.         |
| Assistant | 01:37 | How are you spelling that name, please?                      |
| Alice     | 01:40 | P, E, T. Oh, it doesn't matter.                              |
| Alice     | 01:43 | Can you just put me through to Susan Lehman, please?         |
| Assistant | 01:46 | I'm sorry, Ms. Lehman is unavailable this afternoon.         |
| Alice     | 01:49 | Then why didn't you tell me before?                          |
| Alice     | 01:52 | Well, can you give her a message?                            |
| Assistant | 01:54 | I'm sorry, I'm not able to take messages for that department. |
| Assistant | 01:58 | I'll connect you to Ms. Lehman's assistant.                  |
| Alice     | 02:00 | No, it's all right.                                          |
| Alice     | 02:01 | I'll send her an email.                                      |
| Alice     | 02:03 | Hello? Hello?                                                |
| Assistant | 02:05 | Jane Carrick. Ms. Lehman?                                    |
| Alice     | 02:07 | Never mind.                                                  |

| Alice     | 02:41 | Hello, Ms. Rinaldi?                                          |
| Alice     | 02:42 | This is Alice Pettit, Cameron Diallo's assistant.            |
| Alice     | 02:45 | I'm calling about ...                                        |
| Rinaldi   | 02:46 | Yes, I remember you.                                         |
| Rinaldi   | 02:47 | What can I do for you?                                       |
| Alice     | 02:48 | Well, I'm calling about your meeting with Cameron on May 23rd. |
| Alice     | 02:53 | The thing is, Cameron has to go to Europe that week, so will it be possible to reschedule the meeting? |
| Rinaldi   | 02:59 | May I ask why you set up the meeting if Cameron's away?      |
| Rinaldi   | 03:02 | We only arranged it last week, if you remember.              |
| Alice     | 03:05 | Yes, I'm so sorry.                                           |
| Alice     | 03:07 | She had to change her plans at the last minute.              |
| Rinaldi   | 03:10 | Very well.                                                   |
| Rinaldi   | 03:11 | I'm going to be away myself for three weeks, so we'll have to do the meeting by phone conference. |
| Alice     | 03:17 | Actually, Cameron said she especially wanted to meet you face to face when she gets back, if possible. |
| Rinaldi   | 03:25 | I just said I'm going to be away for three weeks, so it won't be possible. |
| Rinaldi   | 03:29 | I'll be in LA that day anyway, so if Cameron still wants to talk, she can call me at my hotel at the same time. |
| Rinaldi   | 03:35 | I'll email you the number.                                   |
| Alice     | 03:37 | Thank you so much, Ms. Renaldi.                              |
| Rinaldi   | 03:39 | My pleasure.                                                 |
| Rinaldi   | 03:40 | Thank you so much for letting me know.                       |
| Rinaldi   | 03:42 | Goodbye.                                                     |
| Cheryl    | 03:53 | Hello, Ken Johnson's office.                                 |
| Cheryl    | 03:54 | Cheryl Blahnik speaking.                                     |
| Cheryl    | 03:56 | How may I help you?                                          |
| Alice     | 03:57 | Hello, I'm Alice Pettit.                                     |
| Cheryl    | 03:58 | Cameron Diallo's assistant. Right? I remember your name.     |
| Cheryl    | 04:02 | Do you need to speak to Ken?                                 |
| Alice     | 04:04 | Oh, Maybe. I don't know.                                     |
| Alice     | 04:06 | It's about his meeting with Cameron on May 28.               |
| Cheryl    | 04:09 | Wait a moment.                                               |
| Cheryl    | 04:10 | May 28?                                                      |
| Cheryl    | 04:11 | Don't you mean June 4?                                       |
| Alice     | 04:13 | I don't think so.                                            |
| Alice     | 04:15 | Cameron's diary has it for May 28.                           |
| Cheryl    | 04:18 | It was on May 28, but they changed it, didn't they?          |
| Cheryl    | 04:21 | Because they were both away that week.                       |
| Cheryl    | 04:23 | Well, that's what Ken told me anyway.                        |
| Alice     | 04:26 | Of course. I'm sorry. My mistake.                            |
| Alice     | 04:29 | So Cameron will expect Mr. Johnson here on June 4th at 10 am. |
| Cheryl    | 04:34 | If they don't change their minds again.                      |
| Cameron   | 04:44 | So, have you finished rescheduling the meetings?             |
| Alice     | 04:46 | Yes, it wasn't easy.                                         |
| Alice     | 04:49 | Did you want to take a look?                                 |
| Cameron   | 04:52 | Alice, you've put Marina Rinaldi down as a conference call.  |
| Cameron   | 04:55 | I told you I especially wanted to meet with her face to face. |
| Alice     | 04:59 | Yes, but she's away for the first three weeks of June.       |
| Alice     | 05:02 | So?                                                          |
| Cameron   | 05:02 | So why didn't you book her for the week after that?          |
| Alice     | 05:04 | Well, I thought you wanted to talk to her soon.              |
| Cameron   | 05:07 | Oh, never mind.                                              |
| Cameron   | 05:09 | Another thing, why is the Ken Johnson meeting on this list?  |
| Cameron   | 05:12 | It's on June 4, after I come back.                           |
| Alice     | 05:14 | Yes, but it was in the week that you were away.              |
| Cameron   | 05:17 | I know it was that's why I changed it.                       |
| Cameron   | 05:20 | In fact, Ken called me yesterday to change it.               |
| Cameron   | 05:22 | He's away that week too.                                     |
| Cameron   | 05:25 | It's all right, Alice.                                       |
| Cameron   | 05:27 | You're doing your best.                                      |
| Cameron   | 05:29 | I do realize that.                                           |
