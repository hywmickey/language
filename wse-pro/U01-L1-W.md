You know the procedure to follow in these situations:

Second, tell me how many there were ... exactly.

This has top priority.

First, we have to tell all the managers about the accident.

Reschedule your other work and concentrate on this.

There were some journalists visiting the factory.
Do they know about the contaminated bottles?
I'm afraid so. There's a story in today's paper.
This is extremely serious.

The newspapers have completely forgotten about our little problem.

Hello, Max Danos.
What can I do for you, Alfredo?
Is it serious?
So what is the problem exactly?
What procedure did you follow?
That was the correct procedure.
There's no need to phone me if you follow the correct procedure.
Anything else?
What is it?
Oh, were any of these bottles contaminated?
What do your quality control people say?
Good.
And have you found all the bottles which left the factory and got them back?
Well, it seems like you followed the correct procedure then.
Is that all?
