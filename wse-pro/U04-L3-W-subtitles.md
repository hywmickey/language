| Cameron | 00:01 | Ah, Alice, great.                                            |
| Cameron | 00:02 | You haven't gone yet?                                        |
| Alice   | 00:04 | Well, no, but ...                                            |
| Cameron | 00:06 | Don't worry, this won't take long. It's good news, anyway.   |
| Cameron | 00:13 | I'd like you to do some real marketing, Alice.               |
| Cameron | 00:16 | In a small starting sort of way, of course.                  |
| Cameron | 00:20 | You remember those market research guys from New York?       |
| Alice   | 00:23 | Charlie and Helen?                                           |
| Alice   | 00:24 | Sure.                                                        |
| Cameron | 00:25 | Well, we've hired them and signed the contract and they're coming here next Monday to get started. |
| Alice   | 00:30 | Great. But ...                                               |
| Cameron | 00:30 | Let me finish, Alice.                                        |
| Cameron | 00:32 | So they don't know anything about our products and someone needs to brief them. |
| Cameron | 00:36 | I've decided that someone is going to be you.                |
| Alice   | 00:40 | Wow.                                                         |
| Alice   | 00:41 | Really?                                                      |
| Alice   | 00:42 | That's amazing.                                              |
| Alice   | 00:44 | So, how would you like me to go about it?                    |
| Cameron | 00:46 | I think you just need to put together a short presentation.  |
| Cameron | 00:49 | Use PowerPoint.                                              |
| Cameron | 00:50 | That will be fine.                                           |
| Cameron | 00:51 | Say no more than 20 minutes.                                 |
| Cameron | 00:53 | Ten slides will probably be enough.                          |
| Cameron | 00:55 | And print them out so we can give them to Charlie and Helen to take away. |
| Alice   | 01:03 | Excuse me, Dominic.                                          |
| Alice   | 01:04 | Got a moment?                                                |
| Dominic | 01:05 | I'm kind of busy right now, Alice.                           |
| Dominic | 01:07 | What is it?                                                  |
| Alice   | 01:09 | Well, I need some information for this presentation.         |
| Alice   | 01:12 | And as you've been here longer than me.                      |
| Dominic | 01:14 | What do you need to know?                                    |
| Dominic | 01:16 | How much Steve earns?                                        |
| Dominic | 01:18 | Who paid for Cameron's BMW?                                  |
| Alice   | 01:21 | No, I'm trying to find out about AlcoBerry to see if we still make it anywhere in the world. |
| Alice   | 01:26 | I know we don't make it in the us.                           |
| Dominic | 01:28 | AlcoBerry.                                                   |
| Alice   | 01:29 | You know, the drink we make or made specially for bars and clubs. |
| Alice   | 01:35 | BerryAde plus alcohol.                                       |
| Alice   | 01:37 | You mean you've never heard of it?                           |
| Dominic | 01:39 | It's news to me.                                             |
| Dominic | 01:40 | So do we still make it?                                      |
| Alice   | 01:42 | It's okay, no problem.                                       |
| Alice   | 01:51 | So this slide shows the state of the market in 1991.         |
| Alice   | 01:55 | I did it as a pie chart.                                     |
| Alice   | 01:56 | The red piece is us.                                         |
| Bob     | 01:58 | Hmm.                                                         |
| Bob     | 01:58 | Well done.                                                   |
| Bob     | 01:59 | Looks very professional.                                     |
| Alice   | 02:01 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Alice   | 02:02 | The thing is, Bob, I can't find any market data before 1990. |
| Alice   | 02:06 | It's not in the database.                                    |
| Alice   | 02:08 | So. You know, I thought as you've been here for a long time. |
| Bob     | 02:14 | Yeah, I know.                                                |
| Bob     | 02:14 | You don't have to tell me.                                   |
| Alice   | 02:15 | Sorry.You know ...                                           |
| Bob     | 02:17 | It's all right.                                              |
| Bob     | 02:17 | Just having some fun.                                        |
| Bob     | 02:19 | So, what would you like to know?                             |
| Alice   | 02:20 | Well, really, I need to know our market share and the size of the market right from the start up to 1990. |
| Alice   | 02:32 | So this slide shows our share of the market from 1965 through last year. |
| Alice   | 02:36 | It's a graph, as you can see.                                |
| Alice   | 02:38 | And it rises from 1965 to 1983.                              |
| Alice   | 02:42 | Then it stays about the same till 1993 and starts falling slowly. |
| Alice   | 02:47 | Then from 2001 it starts falling faster.                     |
| Alice   | 02:50 | Now this next slide is very interesting.                     |
| Alice   | 02:53 | It's a bar chart showing the total market and our Share of the market. |
| Alice   | 02:57 | The green bar is the total market and the brown bar is our.  |
| Cameron | 03:00 | Can you just hold it for a moment, Alice?                    |
| Cameron | 03:03 | You've done a great job there.                               |
| Cameron | 03:04 | But it's not what I wanted.                                  |
| Alice   | 03:06 | It isn't?                                                    |
| Cameron | 03:07 | They're a market research firm.                              |
| Cameron | 03:08 | We're paying them to find out about our market share and that sort of thing. |
| Alice   | 03:12 | I just wanted to save them some time, that's all.            |
| Cameron | 03:15 | But I didn't ask you to, did I?                              |
| Cameron | 03:17 | I just asked you for a presentation of our product range.    |
| Cameron | 03:22 | Look, I don't even want them to know all that stuff.         |
| Cameron | 03:24 | I want them to start with completely open minds.             |
| Cameron | 03:28 | Don't worry, most of the slides are fine.                    |
| Cameron | 03:30 | Just take out the ones with market information on them. Okay? |
| Alice   | 03:35 | This is a product which you won't see in the United States called AlcoBerry. |
| Alice   | 03:40 | We sell quite a lot of it in Germany and Spain.              |
| Alice   | 03:43 | This slide shows a couple of posters.                        |
| Alice   | 03:45 | But not here in the U.S.                                     |
| Charlie | 03:47 | No. I can see why not.                                       |
| Charlie | 03:49 | You couldn't show a poster like that here.                   |
| Helen   | 03:51 | You couldn't use that poster, of course, but you could still sell the product here. |
| Helen   | 03:56 | So I'm wondering, why don't you.                             |
| Alice   | 03:59 | Cameron, may I tell them?                                    |
| Cameron | 04:01 | Go ahead.                                                    |
| Alice   | 04:02 | Well, it's because of some of our key BarryAde customers, we sell a lot in the Southern United States and ... |
| Charlie | 04:08 | Sorry to interrupt, Alice, but do you have any detail on that? |
| Alice   | 04:12 | Well, I did have a slide showing our market share in the different parts of the country, but ... |
| Cameron | 04:17 | We'll give you all that kind of information when you get started. |
| Cameron | 04:20 | Just carry on with your presentation please, Alice.          |
| Alice   | 04:23 | Yeah, Well, a lot of our southern customers are non drinkers and they don't approve of alcohol. |
| Alice   | 04:29 | So the result was that we lost a lot of market share.        |
| Alice   | 04:33 | In the end, We lost more on BerryAde than we made on AlcoBerry. |
| Dominic | 04:37 | This is a weird country.                                     |
| Charlie | 04:39 | I know what you mean.                                        |
| Alice   | 04:41 | Okay, and here's my last slide, which obviously shows the star of the show and the main reason we're all here, BarryAde. |
| Dominic | 04:48 | Ba ba ba ba ba ba.                                           |
| Dominic | 04:50 | What's the question mark 4?                                  |
| Charlie | 04:52 | But what's the future of BerryAde?                           |
| Dominic | 04:54 | Does it even have a future?                                  |
| Cameron | 04:57 | Okay, well, thanks a lot for that presentation, Alice.       |
| Cameron | 05:00 | That was a very helpful start.                               |
| Charlie | 05:02 | A great job there, Alice.                                    |
| Helen   | 05:03 | Yes, really.                                                 |
| Cameron | 05:05 | So let's start talking about what exactly we want Charlie and Helen to do. |
