| Rick        | 03:29 | Take fitness, for example.                                   | 就拿健身来说吧。                                             |
| Rick        | 03:31 | I set myself a goal three months ago to lift 200 pounds by the end of June. | 三个月前我给自己定了个目标，要在六月底前能举起200磅的重量。  |
| Alice       | 03:35 | So you reached it? I guess.                                  | 那我猜你做到了？                                             |
| Rick        | 03:38 | I did better.                                                | 我做得更好。                                                 |
| Rick        | 03:39 | I reached it at the end of May.                              | 我五月底就做到了。                                           |
| Rick        | 03:40 | I'm lifting 220 pounds now.                                  | 我现在能举220磅了。                                          |
| Alice       | 03:43 | Well, I can see you're very organized in your private life.  | 嗯，看得出来你在个人生活中非常有条理。                       |
| Alice       | 03:48 | Can you give me an example from work?                        | 你能举一个工作中的例子吗？                                   |
| Rick        | 03:51 | Okay, but let me ask you a question.                         | 好的，但我先问你一个问题。                                   |
| Rick        | 03:54 | Do you have a database of all your contacts here in the marketing department? | 你们营销部门有所有联系人的数据库吗？                         |
| Alice       | 03:58 | Sort of.                                                     | 算是有吧。                                                   |
| Alice       | 03:59 | Not exactly.                                                 | 也不能完全算。                                               |
| Alice       | 04:02 | I keep an Outlook address list.                              | 我只在Outlook里建了一个地址列表。                            |
| Alice       | 04:05 | I guess that's not what you mean.                            | 我猜这不是你说的那种（数据库）。                             |
| Rick        | 04:07 | No, you need much more than that.                            | 没错，你们需要的远不止这些。                                 |
| Rick        | 04:10 | At my last company, I set up a database which everyone could access with a webpage for every contact. | 在上一家公司，我搭建了一个数据库，所有人都能访问，每个联系人都有对应的专属网页。 |
| Alice       | 04:17 | Okay, great.                                                 | 好的，很不错。                                               |
| Alice       | 04:19 | One other question.                                          | 还有一个问题。                                               |
| Alice       | 04:21 | How do you feel about doing basic administrative work?       | 你觉得做基础的行政工作怎么样？                               |
| Alice       | 04:25 | Stuff like booking flights and hotels, setting up meetings and so on. | 比如预订机票和酒店、安排会议之类的事。                       |
| Rick        | 04:29 | That's okay.                                                 | 没问题的。                                                   |
| Rick        | 04:30 | Someone has to do that admin stuff.                          | 总得有人做这些行政活儿。                                     |
| Rick        | 04:32 | I guess, you started out doing it, right and now you're moving on up. | 我猜你一开始也是做这些的，对吧？现在你已经升职了。           |
| Rick        | 04:36 | I'll do the same thing.                                      | 我也会走同样的路（先做基础行政，再求升职）。                 |
| Interviewee | 04:39 | So I stayed at Global bank for three years?                  | 我在环球银行待了三年是吗？                                   |
| Interviewee | 04:44 | No, two years and 10 months exactly.                         | 不，准确来说是两年零十个月。                                 |
| Alice       | 04:47 | And what were your duties at Global Bank?                    | 你在环球银行的工作职责是什么？                               |
| Interviewee | 04:51 | My job title was administrative assistant.                   | 我的职位是行政助理。                                         |
| Interviewee | 04:56 | And I took notes at meetings.                                | 我负责做会议记录。                                           |
| Interviewee | 04:58 | I kept records of all the managers, vacation dates, travel arrangements and so on. | 我记录所有经理的休假日期、差旅安排等事宜。                   |
| Interviewee | 05:05 | I was also in charge of paper, pens and other office supplies. | 我还负责管理纸张、笔和其他办公用品。                         |
| Alice       | 05:11 | Okay, great.                                                 | 好的，很不错。                                               |
| Alice       | 05:12 | Thanks.                                                      | 谢谢。                                                       |
| Alice       | 05:14 | Look, excuse me a moment.                                    | 那个，不好意思，我失陪一下。                                 |
| Alice       | 05:15 | I just need to go and talk to someone.                       | 我得去跟人说句话。                                           |
| Rick        | 05:20 | Hi.                                                          | 嗨。                                                         |
| Rick        | 05:20 | Have you finished the last interview then?                   | 那你结束最后一场面试了吗？                                   |
| Rick        | 05:22 | Do I get to meet your boss now?                              | 我现在能见到你的老板了吗？                                   |
| Alice       | 05:24 | Hold on, Rick.                                               | 稍等一下，里克。                                             |
| Alice       | 05:25 | I'll catch you later. Okay?                                  | 我待会儿找你。好吗？                                         |
| Cameron     | 05:29 | So why didn't you choose one of them then?                   | 那你为什么没从他们中选一个呢？                               |
| Alice       | 05:31 | I just wasn't sure.                                          | 我只是拿不准。                                               |
| Alice       | 05:33 | The first one definitely wasn't right, but the other two had their good points and their bad points. | 第一个人肯定不合适，但另外两个人各有优缺点。                 |
| Alice       | 05:39 | For example, the second guy was very organized and he had a lot of energy, but maybe too much, if you know what I mean. | 比如，第二个人非常有条理，也很有精力，但可能精力太旺盛了，你懂我的意思吧。 |
| Alice       | 05:47 | The third one is organized too, but she's kind of boring and doesn't have much energy. | 第三个人也很有条理，但她有点无趣，也没什么活力。             |
| Cameron     | 05:52 | So where's the problem?                                      | 那问题出在哪儿？                                             |
| Cameron     | 05:53 | Do you want to work with someone who's boring and has no energy. | 你难道想和一个无趣又没活力的人共事吗？                       |
| Alice       | 05:57 | Well, I guess not.                                           | 嗯，我想也不想。                                             |
| Cameron     | 05:58 | And I don't either.                                          | 我也不想。                                                   |
| Cameron     | 05:59 | So bring me the second one in about 20 minutes.              | 那20分钟左右把第二个人带过来见我。                           |
| Cameron     | 06:07 | Hi, Alice.                                                   | 嗨，艾丽斯。                                                 |
| Cameron     | 06:08 | I thought Rick was great, an excellent choice.               | 我觉得里克很棒，选得非常好。                                 |
| Alice       | 06:11 | Good. I'm glad you think so.                                 | 太好了。你能这么想我很开心。                                 |
| Cameron     | 06:14 | Only next time, make the decision yourself without asking me. | 只是下次，你自己做决定就好，不用来问我。                     |
| Cameron     | 06:18 | Remember, you're not going to be the junior assistant any longer. | 记住，你不再是初级助理了。                                   |
