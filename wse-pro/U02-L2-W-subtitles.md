| Marsha Bowman  | 01:32 | I'm afraid he couldn't make it today.                        |
| Marsha Bowman  | 01:34 | He had another appointment.                                  |

| Helen Yang     | 02:31 | I'm Helen Yang, VP of Research.                              |
| Cameron        | 02:34 | Hello, Helen.                                                |
| Cameron        | 02:35 | Charlie spoke to me about you.                               |
| Cameron        | 02:37 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron        | 02:37 | I'm Cameron Diallo, CMO.                                     |

| Charlie        | 02:56 | Wow.                                                         |
| Charlie        | 02:56 | Well, thank you all for coming.                              |

| Charlie        | 03:13 | Did you want to add anything, Helen?                         |
| Helen          | 03:15 | No, I think we've said what we needed to say.                |
| Charlie        | 03:18 | So let me just thank you all again for being there and for listening. |
| Charlie        | 03:22 | And we'll be in touch, I hope.                               |
| Cameron        | 03:23 | And thank you, Charlie.                                      |
| Cameron        | 03:25 | It's been very interesting.                                  |
| Cameron        | 03:27 | Like you say, we'll be in touch.                             |
| Cameron        | 03:29 | Bye for now.                                                 |
| Charlie        | 03:30 | Bye.                                                         |
| Cameron        | 03:31 | So, what did you think?                                      |
| Max            | 03:33 | It has to be the second firm.                                |
| Max            | 03:34 | They're more professional, they have hard skills, they're hands on. |
| Max            | 03:37 | They'll get us the information we need.                      |
| Dominic        | 03:39 | The first ones, I mean, did they even want our business?     |
| Dominic        | 03:43 | They send along these two really junior people.              |
| Dominic        | 03:46 | I mean, what do they expect?                                 |
| Bob            | 03:49 | I don't agree.                                               |
| Bob            | 03:50 | If we have to go with anyone, I prefer the local guys.       |
| Dominic        | 03:53 | Why?                                                         |
| Bob            | 03:54 | 80% of our business is in California and the Southwest.      |
| Bob            | 03:57 | So we need to use a local firm.                              |
| Bob            | 03:59 | How can we expect New Yorkers to understand the way we do things down here? |
| Cameron        | 04:03 | They don't come from a different planet, Bob.                |
| Cameron        | 04:05 | We do all live in the same country.                          |
| Bob            | 04:08 | And the first guys were cheaper, too.                        |
| Bob            | 04:09 | If we're going to throw money away, let's not throw away more than we have to. |
| Luara          | 04:14 | Bob has a point there.                                       |
| Luara          | 04:16 | We don't really have a budget for this, you know.            |
| Cameron        | 04:18 | Well, thank you all for coming and for sharing your ideas and opinions, which I've noted. |
| Cameron        | 04:24 | of course, I'll let you all know what we decide about the market research firms. |
| Cameron        | 04:29 | So that's all for today.                                     |
| Cameron        | 04:31 | Goodbye.                                                     |
