| Role        | Time  | Sentence                                                     |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cameron     | 00:01 | Steve and I have been talking about it.                      |
| Cameron     | 00:02 | So we've decided we are going to hire a junior assistant right away. |
| Alice       | 00:07 | So what will they do?                                        |
| Cameron     | 00:08 | Oh, basically they'll take over a lot of the everyday administrative stuff. |
| Alice       | 00:12 | Does that mean I won't have to book flights and hotels anymore? |
| Alice       | 00:15 | Cool!                                                        |
| Cameron     | 00:16 | And I always thought you liked your job.                     |
| Cameron     | 00:22 | What a day.                                                  |
| Cameron     | 00:23 | So when are the marketing assistants coming?                 |
| Alice       | 00:25 | 2:30, 3:15 and 4.                                            |
| Cameron     | 00:28 | You gave them 45 minutes each.                               |
| Cameron     | 00:29 | Too long.                                                    |
| Alice       | 00:30 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Alice       | 00:31 | I thought it's better to have.                               |
| Cameron     | 00:32 | Doesn't make any difference.                                 |
| Cameron     | 00:33 | Anyway, I haven't got time for any of them.                  |
| Cameron     | 00:36 | You'll have to do the interviews.                            |
| Cameron     | 00:37 | Think you can handle it?                                     |
| Alice       | 00:38 | Well, yes, I think so.                                       |
| Alice       | 00:41 | If you can just give me an idea of what you're looking for.  |
| Cameron     | 00:44 | You know, the obvious things.                                |
| Cameron     | 00:46 | Hard working, intelligent, doesn't ask too many unnecessary questions. |
| Cameron     | 00:53 | Someone like you, Alice.                                     |
| Cameron     | 00:55 | So choose the best of the three and bring him or her along to me around five. |
| Cameron     | 00:59 | Okay, Good.                                                  |
| Cameron     | 01:00 | Here are their resumes and all of the other stuff.           |
| Alice       | 01:05 | Nadia.                                                       |
| Alice       | 01:06 | Pleased to meet you.                                         |
| Alice       | 01:07 | I'm Alice Pettit, marketing assistant.                       |
| Nadia       | 01:10 | Hi Alice.                                                    |
| Alice       | 01:11 | Did you find us okay?                                        |
| Nadia       | 01:13 | No problem.                                                  |
| Nadia       | 01:14 | I live just a couple of miles away.                          |
| Alice       | 01:15 | Okay, here we are.                                           |
| Alice       | 01:18 | So, Nadia, what makes you want to work for Berryco?          |
| Nadia       | 01:22 | Oh, well, you know, Berryco is such a famous company.        |
| Nadia       | 01:27 | My mom used to drink BerryAde when she was a kid.            |
| Alice       | 01:29 | What about this job then?                                    |
| Alice       | 01:32 | What attracts you to working in the marketing department here? |
| Nadia       | 01:35 | Oh, you know, I've always wanted to work in marketing.       |
| Nadia       | 01:38 | It's something I really have a feel for.                     |
| Nadia       | 01:41 | Can I show you some of my ideas?                             |
| Nadia       | 01:45 | This one shows a little girl who's crying and then her mom gives her a bottle of BerryAde and she stops crying. |
| Nadia       | 01:52 | And in this one you have a group of young people at a party. |
| Alice       | 01:55 | That's great, Nadia, but it's not really what we're looking for. |
| Nadia       | 02:00 | They're just ideas, you know.                                |
| Alice       | 02:02 | I mean, we're just looking for a marketing assistant to do administrative work. |
| Nadia       | 02:07 | Well, I know, but I wanted to show you how much I care about marketing. |
| Alice       | 02:11 | That's great.                                                |
| Alice       | 02:12 | Okay, but let me ask you.                                    |
| Alice       | 02:16 | Are you a tidy, organized kind of person?                    |
| Alice       | 02:20 | Do you always know where to find things?                     |
| Nadia       | 02:22 | Well, you know, I can be, but it's not really who I am.      |
| Nadia       | 02:25 | I'm more of a creative person.                               |
| Nadia       | 02:27 | I love writing, painting, playing music.                     |
| Nadia       | 02:31 | That's why I want to work in marketing.                      |
| Alice       | 02:36 | So thank you for coming in, Nadia.                           |
| Alice       | 02:38 | We'll be in touch.                                           |
| Nadia       | 02:39 | Okay, well, thank you.                                       |
| Nadia       | 02:41 | I'm sorry we didn't have a bit more time.                    |
| Nadia       | 02:45 | Okay, bye.                                                   |
| Nadia       | 02:46 | Bye, Alice.                                                  |
| Nadia       | 02:47 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Rick        | 02:53 | Excuse me, is this the right place for the marketing assistant interview? |
| Alice       | 02:57 | That's right.                                                |
| Alice       | 02:59 | Did the receptionist tell you just to come straight in?      |
| Rick        | 03:03 | Oh, I didn't speak with her.                                 |
| Rick        | 03:04 | She seemed kind of busy.                                     |
| Rick        | 03:06 | That girl who just came out.                                 |
| Rick        | 03:07 | Nadia?                                                       |
| Alice       | 03:08 | That's right.                                                |
| Rick        | 03:09 | I asked Nadia where the interview room was.                  |
| Rick        | 03:11 | Then she showed me.                                          |
| Alice       | 03:13 | Okay, great.                                                 |
| Alice       | 03:14 | Well, take a seat, Rick, and let's get started.              |
| Rick        | 03:19 | I'm very much a planning and organizing kind of guy.         |
| Rick        | 03:22 | I set goals for myself and I make sure I reach them.         |
| Alice       | 03:25 | Can you give me an example?                                  |
| Rick        | 03:27 | Sure, no problem.                                            |
| Rick        | 03:29 | Take fitness, for example.                                   |
| Rick        | 03:31 | I set myself a goal three months ago to lift 200 pounds by the end of June. |
| Alice       | 03:35 | So you reached it? I guess.                                  |
| Rick        | 03:38 | I did better.                                                |
| Rick        | 03:39 | I reached it at the end of May.                              |
| Rick        | 03:40 | I'm lifting 220 pounds now.                                  |
| Alice       | 03:43 | Well, I can see you're very organized in your private life.  |
| Alice       | 03:48 | Can you give me an example from work?                        |
| Rick        | 03:51 | Okay, but let me ask you a question.                         |
| Rick        | 03:54 | Do you have a database of all your contacts here in the marketing department? |
| Alice       | 03:58 | Sort of.                                                     |
| Alice       | 03:59 | Not exactly.                                                 |
| Alice       | 04:02 | I keep an Outlook address list.                              |
| Alice       | 04:05 | I guess that's not what you mean.                            |
| Rick        | 04:07 | No, you need much more than that.                            |
| Rick        | 04:10 | At my last company, I set up a database which everyone could access with a webpage for every contact. |
| Alice       | 04:17 | Okay, great.                                                 |
| Alice       | 04:19 | One other question.                                          |
| Alice       | 04:21 | How do you feel about doing basic administrative work?       |
| Alice       | 04:25 | Stuff like booking flights and hotels, setting up meetings and so on. |
| Rick        | 04:29 | That's okay.                                                 |
| Rick        | 04:30 | Someone has to do that admin stuff.                          |
| Rick        | 04:32 | I guess, you started out doing it, right and now you're moving on up. |
| Rick        | 04:36 | I'll do the same thing.                                      |
| Interviewee | 04:39 | So I stayed at Global bank for three years?                  |
| Interviewee | 04:44 | No, two years and 10 months exactly.                         |
| Alice       | 04:47 | And what were your duties at Global Bank?                    |
| Interviewee | 04:51 | My job title was administrative assistant.                   |
| Interviewee | 04:56 | And I took notes at meetings.                                |
| Interviewee | 04:58 | I kept records of all the managers, vacation dates, travel arrangements and so on. |
| Interviewee | 05:05 | I was also in charge of paper, pens and other office supplies. |
| Alice       | 05:11 | Okay, great.                                                 |
| Alice       | 05:12 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Alice       | 05:14 | Look, excuse me a moment.                                    |
| Alice       | 05:15 | I just need to go and talk to someone.                       |
| Rick        | 05:20 | Hi.                                                          |
| Rick        | 05:20 | Have you finished the last interview then?                   |
| Rick        | 05:22 | Do I get to meet your boss now?                              |
| Alice       | 05:24 | Hold on, Rick.                                               |
| Alice       | 05:25 | I'll catch you later. Okay?                                  |
| Cameron     | 05:29 | So why didn't you choose one of them then?                   |
| Alice       | 05:31 | I just wasn't sure.                                          |
| Alice       | 05:33 | The first one definitely wasn't right, but the other two had their good points and their bad points. |
| Alice       | 05:39 | For example, the second guy was very organized and he had a lot of energy, but maybe too much, if you know what I mean. |
| Alice       | 05:47 | The third one is organized too, but she's kind of boring and doesn't have much energy. |
| Cameron     | 05:52 | So where's the problem?                                      |
| Cameron     | 05:53 | Do you want to work with someone who's boring and has no energy. |
| Alice       | 05:57 | Well, I guess not.                                           |
| Cameron     | 05:58 | And I don't either.                                          |
| Cameron     | 05:59 | So bring me the second one in about 20 minutes.              |
| Cameron     | 06:07 | Hi, Alice.                                                   |
| Cameron     | 06:08 | I thought Rick was great, an excellent choice.               |
| Alice       | 06:11 | Good. I'm glad you think so.                                 |
| Cameron     | 06:14 | Only next time, make the decision yourself without asking me. |
| Cameron     | 06:18 | Remember, you're not going to be the junior assistant any longer. |
