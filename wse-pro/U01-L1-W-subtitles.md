| Steve          | 00:02 | Morning, Alice.                                              |
| Steve          | 00:02 | Everything all right?                                        |
| Alice          | 00:03 | Yes, fine.                                                   |
| Steve          | 00:04 | Is Cameron in yet?                                           |
| Alice          | 00:11 | Oh, hello, Cameron.                                          |
| Alice          | 00:12 | Did you have a good trip?                                    |
| Cameron        | 00:13 | Yeah, I was fine.                                            |
| Cameron        | 00:14 | So who called while I was away?                              |
| Alice          | 00:16 | I think I passed on all the important people.                |
| Alice          | 00:19 | Did you get to speak to Barbara Houghton from TransAmerican Airlines? |
| Cameron        | 00:22 | Yeah, it was nothing.                                        |
| Alice          | 00:23 | Sorry, I thought.                                            |
| Cameron        | 00:24 | Oh, it doesn't matter.                                       |
| Cameron        | 00:26 | I'll just go and check my voicemail then.                    |
| Alice          | 00:34 | Good morning.                                                |
| Alice          | 00:34 | Alice Pettit, Cameron Dallas assistant.                      |
| Alice          | 00:36 | How can I help?                                              |
| Alice          | 00:37 | Oh, hello, Cameron.                                          |
| Alice          | 00:40 | Of course.                                                   |
| Alice          | 00:40 | Right away.                                                  |
| Cameron        | 00:50 | Alice, I've just listened to my voicemail and I heard this.  |
| Ken Johnson    | 00:56 | Hi, Cameron.                                                 |
| Ken Johnson    | 00:56 | This is Ken Johnson.                                         |
| Ken Johnson    | 00:57 | Would you get back to me as soon as you can, please?         |
| Ken Johnson    | 01:00 | Bye.                                                         |
| Cameron        | 01:01 | So what's going on?                                          |
| Cameron        | 01:02 | Do you even know who he is?                                  |
| Alice          | 01:05 | I'm sorry, no.                                               |
| Cameron        | 01:07 | He's the CEO of Priceway Supermarkets.                       |
| Alice          | 01:11 | Oh, dear.                                                    |
| Alice          | 01:12 | They're important customers, aren't they?                    |
| Cameron        | 01:15 | You could say that.                                          |
| Cameron        | 01:16 | They buy about 30% of our production.                        |
| Alice          | 01:19 | I'm so sorry, Cameron.                                       |
| Alice          | 01:20 | It's just that he didn't say where he was from.              |
| Cameron        | 01:23 | He doesn't have to say where he's from.                      |
| Cameron        | 01:26 | He thinks people are going to know.                          |
| Alice          | 01:28 | Just one thing.                                              |
| Alice          | 01:30 | If Ken is such an important contact, doesn't he have your cell phone number? |
| Cameron        | 01:34 | Alice, it's not your job to think about who has or who doesn't have my cell phone number. |
| Cameron        | 01:39 | If Ken Johnson calls at 3 am When I'm on vacation, you just pass the call to me straight away, okay? |
| Alice          | 01:46 | Sure.                                                        |
| Alice          | 01:47 | I'm sorry again.                                             |
| Cameron        | 01:49 | And the same goes for any other important contacts.          |
| Cameron        | 01:52 | So make sure you know who they are.                          |
| Cameron        | 01:56 | And don't waste my time with people like Barbara Houghton either. |
| Alice          | 02:00 | No, Cameron.                                                 |
| Alice          | 02:01 | See you later.                                               |
| Cameron        | 02:02 | Oh, and I'm going to be out or busy for the rest of the day, so please pick up my calls and try to get it right this time. |
| Alice          | 02:10 | I'll do my best.                                             |
| Alice          | 02:11 | No, I'll just get it right.                                  |
| Alice          | 02:20 | Good morning.                                                |

| Alice          | 02:22 | How can I help you?                                          |

| Harold Mantrel | 03:48 | Harold Mantrel from the University of Santa Clara.           |
| Alice          | 03:52 | I'm sorry, but Ms. Diallo is out of the office today.        |
| Alice          | 03:55 | Perhaps I can help you.                                      |
| Harold Mantrel | 03:57 | I really don't think so.                                     |
| Harold Mantrel | 03:59 | I'm calling to give Ms. Diallo some information which she asked for. |
| Alice          | 04:02 | Maybe you can send her an email.                             |
| Harold Mantrel | 04:04 | Oh, I don't want to waste my time writing emails.            |

| Alice          | 04:10 | I do understand, Mr. Mantro.                                 |

| Harold Mantrel | 04:18 | But can you ask her to call me back as soon as possible, please? |
| Alice          | 04:21 | Certainly, Mr. Mantro.                                       |
| Alice          | 04:26 | So you didn't want to speak to him?                          |
| Cameron        | 04:28 | No way.                                                      |
| Cameron        | 04:29 | He can't shut up.                                            |
| Cameron        | 04:31 | He's doing some technical research for us.                   |
| Cameron        | 04:33 | I'll just ask him to put it in writing.                      |
| Cameron        | 04:36 | So who else called while I was out?                          |
| Alice          | 04:38 | Well, there was some guy called Liam Connolly.               |
| Cameron        | 04:41 | And?                                                         |
| Alice          | 04:42 | So I just took his details in case you wanted to call him.   |
| Cameron        | 04:45 | Well, I don't.                                               |
| Cameron        | 04:46 | He's another time waster.                                    |
| Cameron        | 04:48 | You're learning, Alice.                                      |
| Alice          | 04:49 | Thank you.                                                   |
| Alice          | 04:50 | Well, I hope so.                                             |
