Have you arranged our Asia itinerary yet?
We're going on a trip to China, Korea, and Japan.
So you're going to Japan first, presumably?
Why do you assume that?
It's on the way.
It's nearer to California than Seoul or Shanghai.
There's one hour difference in flight time.
We'll start in Shanghai.
How long do you need in Shanghai? Two full days?
We'll go to Seoul next.
We stay two or three days in Seoul, depending on whether that meeting happends or not.
And then to Tokyo, for the press conference.

We've got the two formal meetings. plus a visit to the factory.
Do you want to add in a bit of time for sightseeing?
Give us a couple of hours for shopping, if you can fit it in.
I'm sure the Chinese will arrange something for you.
One of the people hasn't confirmed, so can you check with them?
Am I supposed to organize anything?
No, the Japanese PR company's taking care of everything.

We have three marketing meetings in Lisbon.
I'd like to add in some time to see the city.
I think the Portuguese company is planning something for you.
We need to confirm one of the meetings.
Our schedule depends on whether that meeting is happening.
The convention was arranged a long time ago.
