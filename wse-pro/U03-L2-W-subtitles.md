| Cameron | 00:00 | Damn, it's already 2:30.                                     |
| Cameron | 00:02 | Alice, do you think you can write a report on the Ken Johnson meeting? |
| Alice   | 00:05 | Sure.                                                        |
| Alice   | 00:06 | Yeah, I think so.                                            |
| Cameron | 00:07 | After all, you were in the meeting and you took notes.       |
| Cameron | 00:10 | Did you get all the action points?                           |
| Alice   | 00:12 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alice   | 00:13 | Well, I hope so.                                             |
| Cameron | 00:14 | Okay, great.                                                 |
| Cameron | 00:15 | So write the report and send it to Ken directly.             |
| Alice   | 00:18 | Do you want me to put your name on it?                       |
| Cameron | 00:20 | No, write it as if it comes from you.                        |
| Cameron | 00:22 | Well, it does come from you, but send it to me first.        |
| Cameron | 00:26 | I want to check it over.                                     |
| Alice   | 00:33 | Hi, Ken.                                                     |
| Alice   | 00:34 | I'm Alice Pettit, Cameron's assistant.                       |
| Alice   | 00:36 | It was really great to meet you.                             |
| Alice   | 00:38 | That was a fantastic meeting we had this afternoon.          |
| Alice   | 00:41 | Thanks a lot for coming over.                                |
| Alice   | 00:43 | So let me just tell you the action points which we took away from the meeting. |
| Alice   | 00:53 | I hope that's cool by you.                                   |
| Alice   | 00:54 | If not, please let us know.                                  |
| Alice   | 00:57 | Catch you later, Alice and Cameron.                          |
| Alice   | 01:01 | I think that's everything.                                   |
| Alice   | 01:03 | Send.                                                        |
| Alice   | 01:05 | Okay, so what's next?                                        |
| Alice   | 01:17 | Hello, alice pettit, cameron diallos.                        |
| Alice   | 01:20 | Oh, cameron, is something wrong?                             |
| Alice   | 01:23 | Oh.                                                          |
| Cameron | 01:32 | Alice, what were you thinking?                               |
| Cameron | 01:34 | I hope that's cool by you.                                   |
| Cameron | 01:36 | Catch you later.                                             |
| Cameron | 01:38 | Who do you think you're talking to?                          |
| Cameron | 01:39 | Your college roommate?                                       |
| Alice   | 01:41 | Sorry, it's just.                                            |
| Alice   | 01:43 | Well, I wanted to be friendly.                               |
| Alice   | 01:44 | I mean, you always call him Ken and he calls you Cameron.    |
| Cameron | 01:48 | Yeah, I call him Ken.                                        |
| Cameron | 01:50 | That doesn't mean that you do.                               |
| Cameron | 01:52 | Anyway, you're writing an email.                             |
| Cameron | 01:54 | You have to be more formal than when you're speaking.        |
| Cameron | 01:57 | Didn't they teach you anything in college?                   |
| Cameron | 02:00 | So go and do it again.                                       |
| Cameron | 02:02 | And please get it right this time.                           |
| Alice   | 02:09 | Dear Mr. Johnson, my name is Alice Pettit.                   |
| Alice   | 02:12 | I'm Cameron Diallo's assistant.                              |
| Alice   | 02:14 | You may remember me from the meeting.                        |
| Alice   | 02:17 | Cameron would like to thank you for coming over to our offices and to say how much she enjoyed the meeting. |
| Alice   | 02:23 | Here are the action points for BerryCo as we see them.       |
| Alice   | 02:33 | If there is anything that you would like to change, please let us know. |
| Alice   | 02:37 | Best regards, Alice Pettit for Cameron Diallo at last.       |
| Alice   | 02:43 | Send.                                                        |
| Alice   | 02:46 | So, what's next?                                             |
| Alice   | 02:47 | Oh no.                                                       |
| Alice   | 02:49 | Another email to Steve.                                      |
| Alice   | 03:00 | Dear Mr. Lee, I'm writing to you about the meeting between Cameron and Mr. Ken Johnson of Priceway Supermarkets on Tuesday, September 15th at 3pm. Mr. Johnson would like to know if it is possible for us to arrange. |
| Alice   | 03:22 | If you require any further information, please let me or Cameron know. |
| Alice   | 03:27 | Yours truly, Alice Pettit for Cameron Diallo.                |
| Alice   | 03:31 | I guess I'll send it to Cameron first.                       |
| Alice   | 03:35 | No more emails.                                              |
| Alice   | 03:36 | Hooray.                                                      |
| Alice   | 03:46 | Is it about those emails again?                              |
| Cameron | 03:48 | Yes, of course it is.                                        |
| Alice   | 03:50 | What?                                                        |
| Alice   | 03:50 | The one to Ken Johnson?                                      |
| Cameron | 03:51 | No, no, that was all right.                                  |
| Cameron | 03:53 | It was the other one to Steve.                               |
| Alice   | 03:55 | I Tried to make it more formal after what you said .         |
| Cameron | 03:59 | And you went too far the other way.                          |
| Cameron | 04:00 | You don't have to be so formal with Steve.                   |
| Cameron | 04:02 | You see him nearly every day.                                |
| Cameron | 04:05 | You call him by his first name.                              |
| Alice   | 04:07 | But Steve is the CEO of the company.                         |
| Alice   | 04:10 | Just like Ken Johnson.                                       |
| Cameron | 04:11 | Steve's younger than Ken.                                    |
| Cameron | 04:13 | His style is more informal.                                  |
| Cameron | 04:15 | Like I said, you work in the same office anyway.             |
| Cameron | 04:18 | And you don't need to put in so many details either.         |
| Cameron | 04:20 | Steve knows who Ken is and what company he comes from.       |
| Cameron | 04:24 | Come on Alice, use your head.                                |
| Cameron | 04:26 | Please redo the email and send it to me again.               |
| Alice   | 04:34 | Hello Steve.                                                 |
| Alice   | 04:36 | Cameron asked me to send you a report on her meeting with Ken Johnson this afternoon. |
| Alice   | 04:47 | If there's anything else you need to know, please ask.       |
| Alice   | 04:50 | Regards Alice.                                               |
| Alice   | 04:52 | For Cameron.                                                 |
| Alice   | 04:54 | I guess that's okay.                                         |
| Alice   | 04:57 | Hey, cool.                                                   |
| Alice   | 04:58 | It's from Dana.                                              |
| Dana    | 05:00 | Hi Alice.                                                    |
| Dana    | 05:00 | How's the job going?                                         |
| Dana    | 05:02 | Isn't it a bit boring working for an old fashioned company like Barrico? |
| Dana    | 05:12 | So I hope you'll come and stay with me in New York.          |
| Dana    | 05:15 | We can go to some really amazing parties.                    |
| Dana    | 05:17 | Loving kisses, Dana.                                         |
| Alice   | 05:21 | Hi Dana, great to hear from you.                             |
| Alice   | 05:24 | You're right about Berry company.                            |
| Alice   | 05:26 | It is an old fashioned company, even if my boss is a bit crazy. |
| Alice   | 05:30 | The problem is the job totally isn't what I expected.        |
| Alice   | 05:34 | I'm basically just a secretary.                              |
| Alice   | 05:42 | Lots of love from your sad little.                           |
| Dominic | 05:45 | Writing, private emails and company time.                    |
| Alice   | 05:48 | I finished it anyway.                                        |
| Alice   | 05:50 | Send.                                                        |
| Alice   | 05:53 | No, no, no, no, no, no.                                      |
| Dominic | 05:57 | What is it?                                                  |
| Alice   | 05:58 | That email to my friend.                                     |
| Alice   | 05:59 | I just sent it to Cameron.                                   |
| Dominic | 06:01 | Oh dear, not a good idea.                                    |
| Dominic | 06:05 | What did you say?                                            |
| Alice   | 06:06 | Oh nothing.                                                  |
| Alice   | 06:07 | I just said that the company was boring and old fashioned and Cameron was crazy and that I hated my job. |
| Alice   | 06:15 | Speaking of my job.                                          |
| Alice   | 06:17 | There it goes.                                               |
| Alice   | 06:20 | Hello Cameron.                                               |
| Alice   | 06:21 | Yes, right away.                                             |
| Alice   | 06:24 | Well, it's been nice knowing you Dominic.                    |
| Alice   | 06:27 | So long.                                                     |
| Alice   | 06:34 | What can I say Cameron?                                      |
| Alice   | 06:36 | I'm so, so, so, so sorry.                                    |
| Cameron | 06:40 | What about that email?                                       |
| Cameron | 06:42 | I don't read people's private emails.                        |
| Cameron | 06:45 | I deleted it.                                                |
| Cameron | 06:46 | But please don't email or text your friends during working hours. |
| Cameron | 06:51 | Not when we have so much to do.                              |
| Alice   | 06:53 | No, of course not.                                           |
| Alice   | 06:54 | Never again.                                                 |
| Cameron | 06:56 | Hold on Alice, Sit down for a moment.                        |
| Cameron | 07:00 | You've made a good start here at Barryco.                    |
| Cameron | 07:03 | Don't throw it away.                                         |
| Cameron | 07:05 | Do you know what I mean?                                     |
| Alice   | 07:06 | I think so.                                                  |
| Cameron | 07:08 | You're not at college anymore.                               |
| Cameron | 07:10 | This is the grown up world you're living in now.             |
| Cameron | 07:13 | Maybe it's time to grow up a bit.                            |
| Cameron | 07:15 | You see what I'm saying?                                     |
| Alice   | 07:17 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alice   | 07:17 | Thanks Cameron.                                              |
| Cameron | 07:19 | Anything you wanted to say?                                  |
| Alice   | 07:21 | No.                                                          |
| Cameron | 07:23 | Well, that's all then.                                       |
| Cameron | 07:24 | Go and send me the Steve email please.                       |
| Cameron | 07:26 | And then if you still.                                       |
