| Steve     | 00:03 | Okay, everybody, thanks for coming.                          | 好的，各位，感谢大家到场。|
| Steve     | 00:05 | Max is going to speak in a moment about how we can improve some of our procedures. | 马克斯稍后会讲讲我们该如何改进部分工作流程。|
| Steve     | 00:09 | But I just wanted to start us off with a simple message.     | 但我想先以一句简单的话开场。|
| Steve     | 00:14 | We're wasting money.                                         | 我们正在浪费钱。|
| Steve     | 00:17 | We're ordering stuff we don't need.                          | 我们一直在采购一些根本用不上的东西。|
| Steve     | 00:19 | We're ordering more expensive products instead of cheaper ones. | 我们总买贵的产品，而非更实惠的替代品。|
| Steve     | 00:22 | And it has to stop.                                          | 这种情况必须停止。|
| Steve     | 00:24 | Wasting money is dumb.                                       | 浪费钱是不明智的。|
| Steve     | 00:27 | Saving money is smart.                                       | 省钱才是明智之举。|
| Steve     | 00:29 | It really is as simple as that.                              | 道理其实就是这么简单。|
| Steve     | 00:31 | Well, I'm done.                                              | 好了，我先说这些。|
| Steve     | 00:32 | Over to you, Max.                                            | 接下来交给你了，马克斯。|
| Max       | 00:34 | Hello everybody.                                             | 大家好。|
| Max       | 00:35 | Thanks for coming.                                           | 感谢大家到场。|
| Max       | 00:36 | Okay, I've spent the last few weeks studying some of our ordering procedures here, and there are a lot of problems. | 好的，过去几周我研究了咱们这里的一些采购流程，发现存在不少问题。|
| Max       | 00:44 | People are ordering things without checking if we have them already or how many of them we need. | 大家采购物品时，根本不核实我们是否已有库存，也不确认实际需要的数量。|
| Max       | 00:50 | Take highlighting pens, for example.                         | 就拿荧光笔来说吧。|
| Max       | 00:53 | We have 45 blue pens, 17 orange pens and three yellow pens.  | 我们现有45支蓝色荧光笔、17支橙色的，还有3支黄色的。|
| Max       | 01:01 | So why is this?                                              | 那为什么会出现这种情况呢？|
| Max       | 01:03 | Because people are ordering sets of pens instead of individual pens. | 因为大家都整套装买，而不是单支采购。|
| Max       | 01:09 | But they're only using the yellow and some of the orange ones. | 可大家只用黄色的，偶尔用点橙色的。|
| Max       | 01:14 | No one uses the blue pens at all.                            | 蓝色的荧光笔根本没人用。|
| Max       | 01:17 | We order Those pens at seven fifty a set from Office Guy. | 我们从办公伙计店买这些笔，一套要7.5美元。|
| Max       | 01:22 | But we could get them for one twenty-five each from office Discount. | 但如果从办公折扣店买，单支只要1.25美元。|
| Max       | 01:26 | So I want everyone to find five examples of waste in their department and show how they're going to stop this waste in the future. | 所以我要求每个人都找出自己部门里5个浪费的例子，并说明今后要如何杜绝这些浪费行为。|
| Max       | 01:34 | You have till Friday next week to send me your reports.      | 大家要在下周五前把报告发给我。|
| Luara     | 01:38 | That's going to be really difficult for me, Max.             | 马克斯，这对我来说真的太难了。|
| Luara     | 01:42 | I don't think there's any waste in my department.            | 我觉得我们部门根本没有任何浪费的情况。|
| Max       | 01:45 | I don't agree.                                               | 我不认同。|
| Max       | 01:46 | I found 17 examples of waste in your department, wasting money or time or materials. | 我在你部门发现了17个浪费的例子，要么是浪费钱，要么是浪费时间，要么是浪费物料。|
| Luara     | 01:53 | Are you sure?                                                | 你确定吗？|
| Luara     | 01:54 | Can you give me some examples?                               | 能给我举几个例子吗？|
| Steve     | 01:57 | Thanks, Laura, but I think we probably don't need to go into that level of detail right now. | 谢谢劳拉，但我觉得我们现在没必要深究到这个细节层面。|
| Steve     | 02:01 | Before we go, I want to add one other really important point. | 散会前，我还有一个非常重要的点要补充。|
| Steve     | 02:04 | We're not getting the best prices from our suppliers.        | 我们没有从供应商那里拿到最优惠的价格。|
| Steve     | 02:07 | We're not pressing them hard enough.                         | 我们跟他们压价压得还不够狠。|
| Steve     | 02:09 | That's another way.                                          | 这是另一种浪费钱的情况。|
| Steve     | 02:10 | We're wasting money.                                         | 我们正在浪费钱。|
| Steve     | 02:11 | Okay, team, go to it.                                        | 好了，各位，行动起来吧。|
| Steve     | 02:13 | All of you, let's start getting some great prices and let's really stop that waste. | 所有人都行动起来，争取拿到更优惠的价格，彻底杜绝浪费。|
| Dominic   | 02:19 | I don't believe what I just heard.                           | 我简直不敢相信我刚听到的这些话。|
| Alice     | 02:22 | Yeah, well, a dollar Saved is a dollar earned, etc, etc.     | 是啊，老话都说，省一分就是赚一分，诸如此类的。|
| Alice     | 02:26 | Anyway, how do we share the work?                            | 不管怎样，这些活儿我们该怎么分工？|
| Alice     | 02:29 | If you like, I'll talk to the suppliers and you can look at our procedures. | 如果你愿意的话，我去跟供应商沟通，你负责梳理我们的流程。|
| Dominic   | 02:33 | I really don't know which of the two is less interesting.    | 我真不知道这两件事里，哪一件没那么无聊。|
| Alice     | 02:38 | So I was wondering, can't you do better than that?           | 所以我想问问，你就不能表现得好点儿吗？|
| Assistant | 02:42 | I've already taken off 5%.                                   | 我已经给你降了5%的价格了。|
| Alice     | 02:45 | That's what I'm saying.                                      | 我就是这个意思。|
| Alice     | 02:46 | 5% isn't enough.                                             | 5%的折扣根本不够。|
| Assistant | 02:48 | But the 5% off is only if you order more than 500 folders and you only want 200 so I'm already giving you a great deal. | 但5%的折扣原本是要订购500个文件夹以上才能享受的，而你们只订200个，所以我已经够优惠了。|
| Assistant | 02:57 | Come on, Alice, you aren't usually like this.                | 别这样，爱丽丝，你平时不是这样的。|
| Assistant | 03:01 | What's got into you today?                                   | 你今天是怎么了？|
| Assistant | 03:03 | Boyfriend troubles?                                          | 是跟男朋友闹别扭了？|
| Alice     | 03:04 | No, it's just, you know, we have to find ways of saving money. | 不是的，你知道的，我们必须想办法省钱。|
| Assistant | 03:09 | Tell me about it.                                            | 可不是嘛。|
| Assistant | 03:10 | That's all I hear from my boss too.                          | 我老板也整天跟我念叨这个。|
| Assistant | 03:13 | Save money, Save money. Save money.                          | 省钱，省钱，还是省钱。|
| Assistant | 03:16 | I'm thinking.                                                | 我在琢磨呢。|
| Assistant | 03:17 | So how about your sales conference in Hawaii then?           | 那你们去夏威夷开销售会议的事儿怎么说？|
| Assistant | 03:21 | But I want to keep my job so I don't say it.                 | 但我还想保住工作，所以这话我也就只敢在这儿说说。|
| Alice     | 03:24 | Anyway, back to these folders.                               | 不管了，还是说回文件夹的事儿吧。|
| Alice     | 03:27 | We've always bought them from you, but we are looking at other suppliers, like office discount. | 我们一直都从你这儿买文件夹，但现在也在考虑其他供应商，比如办公折扣店。|
| Assistant | 03:32 | Yeah, everybody talks about office discount.                 | 是啊，所有人都在提办公折扣店这家店。|
| Assistant | 03:35 | Okay, they're cheaper than us.                               | 行吧，他们的价格是比我们低。|
| Assistant | 03:37 | A bit cheaper, but we offer better value for the money.      | 是便宜一点，但我们的性价比更高。|
| Alice     | 03:41 | What do you mean by better value for the money?              | 你说的性价比更高是什么意思？|
| Assistant | 03:43 | We deliver in two days, they deliver in a week.              | 我们两天就能送货，他们得要一周。|
| Alice     | 03:47 | Okay, but we don't care.                                     | 好吧，但我们不在乎这个。|
| Alice     | 03:49 | A week is no problem.                                        | 一周的时间完全没问题。|
| Alice     | 03:50 | What else?                                                   | 还有别的吗？|
| Assistant | 03:52 | Our folders are better quality than theirs.                  | 我们的文件夹质量比他们的好。|
| Assistant | 03:54 | We offer more colors.                                        | 我们的颜色选择也更多。|
| Alice     | 03:56 | I can't see any difference in quality.                       | 我没看出质量上有任何差别。|
| Alice     | 03:58 | And we don't need the extra colors.                          | 而且我们也不需要额外的颜色。|
| Alice     | 04:00 | Blue is fine.                                                | 蓝色就够用了。|
| Assistant | 04:01 | Okay. Okay, you win.                                         | 行吧行吧，算你赢了。|
| Assistant | 04:03 | I'll give you 10% off the list price.                        | 我给你标价的九折优惠。|
| Assistant | 04:06 | Will that do?                                                | 这样总行了吧？|
| Supplier  | 04:09 | Wait a moment.                                               | 等一下。|
| Supplier  | 04:10 | Sunil, we agreed on the price for those computers.           | 苏尼尔，我们之前已经谈好了这批电脑的价格。|
| Supplier  | 04:13 | We said 900 for the laptops and 500 for the desktops.        | 我们说好笔记本电脑900美元一台，台式机500美元一台。|
| Sunil     | 04:17 | Did we?                                                      | 我们谈好了吗？|
| Sunil     | 04:18 | Was that in an email?                                        | 有邮件记录吗？|
| Sunil     | 04:20 | Yes, I can't find it.                                        | 我记得是有的，但我找不到那封邮件了。|
| Sunil     | 04:22 | Can you remember the date?                                   | 你记得是哪天发的吗？|
| Supplier  | 04:24 | It was April 20th.                                           | 是4月20号。|
| Supplier  | 04:26 | You replied the day after saying accepted.                   | 你第二天回复说同意这个价格了。|
| Sunil     | 04:28 | Sunil, hold on, I'm just looking for it.                     | 稍等一下，我这就找邮件。|
| Sunil     | 04:32 | Oh yes, found it.                                            | 哦，找到了。|
| Supplier  | 04:34 | So you accepted the price in writing.                        | 所以你是书面确认接受这个价格的。|
| Supplier  | 04:36 | That means you can't change it now.                          | 这意味着你现在不能改价了。|
| Sunil     | 04:38 | Well, it wasn't exactly in writing.                          | 呃，这算不上严格意义上的书面确认。|
| Sunil     | 04:40 | It was just an email.                                        | 只不过是一封邮件而已。|
| Supplier  | 04:42 | What are you trying to say?                                  | 你到底想说什么？|
| Sunil     | 04:44 | I'm just saying an email isn't a contract, that's all.       | 我只是想说，一封邮件算不上合同，仅此而已。|
| Supplier  | 04:49 | Yeah, I know that.                                           | 是啊，我知道这点。|
| Supplier  | 04:50 | I also know that I just ordered 250 computers after I got your email. | 但我还知道，我收到你的邮件后，已经下单订了250台电脑。|
| Sunil     | 04:55 | Right.                                                       | 好吧。|
| Sunil     | 04:56 | Okay, that's a problem.                                      | 行吧，这确实是个问题。|
| Sunil     | 04:59 | You see, my CEO isn't happy with these prices.               | 你要知道，我们首席执行官对这个价格不满意。|
| Supplier  | 05:04 | So?                                                          | 那又怎样？|
| Sunil     | 05:05 | So he told me to look at some other suppliers or.            | 所以他让我要么找其他供应商，要么……|
| Supplier  | 05:08 | What are you trying to do here?                              | 你这是想干嘛？|
| Supplier  | 05:09 | Kill me?                                                     | 想让我亏本吗？|
| Sunil     | 05:10 | Or get you to reduce your prices?                            | 还是想让你降降价？|
| Supplier  | 05:13 | Ah, the hell with it.                                        | 唉，算了算了。|
| Supplier  | 05:14 | I'll take 30 off the laptops and 20 off the desktops.        | 笔记本电脑每台降30美元，台式机每台降20美元。|
| Supplier  | 05:18 | Don't ask me for anything more.                              | 别再跟我提更多要求了。|
| Supplier  | 05:19 | That's the best I can do.                                    | 这已经是我能做的最大让步了。|
| Steve     | 05:26 | Thanks for coming everybody.                                 | 感谢大家到场。|
| Steve     | 05:28 | Look, I wasn't going to make this into a competition, but then I thought, well, why not? | 本来我没想把这事儿搞成竞赛，但后来一想，哎，为什么不呢？|
| Steve     | 05:33 | Let's have a bit of fun.                                     | 咱们找点乐子也好。|
| Steve     | 05:36 | So who's the winner of the Barico Save Money and Stop Waste competition? | 那么，谁是巴里科省钱杜绝浪费大赛的获胜者呢？|
| Steve     | 05:41 | I won't keep you waiting any longer.                         | 我就不再让大家等了。|
| Steve     | 05:42 | It's sunil he saved $6,250 on the new computer order.        | 是苏尼尔！他在新的电脑订单上省下了6250美元。|
| Steve     | 05:48 | Come here, Sunil.                                            | 苏尼尔，到这儿来。|
| Steve     | 05:50 | Well done.                                                   | 干得漂亮！|
| Steve     | 05:51 | And you know how he did it?                                  | 大家知道他是怎么做到的吗？|
| Steve     | 05:53 | Just by going back to the supplier and pressing him on the price. | 只是回头去找供应商，跟他使劲压价而已。|
| Steve     | 05:57 | That's the way.                                              | 就该这么做！|
| Steve     | 05:58 | So keep pressing, team.                                      | 所以各位，继续跟供应商压价。|
| Steve     | 05:59 | And let's keep those prices down.                            | 把价格都压下去。|
| Steve     | 06:02 | That's all for now.                                          | 今天就先到这儿。|
