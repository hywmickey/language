| Steve     | 00:03 | Okay, everybody, thanks for coming.                          |
| Steve     | 00:05 | Max is going to speak in a moment about how we can improve some of our procedures. |
| Steve     | 00:09 | But I just wanted to start us off with a simple message.     |
| Steve     | 00:14 | We're wasting money.                                         |
| Steve     | 00:17 | We're ordering stuff we don't need.                          |
| Steve     | 00:19 | We're ordering more expensive products instead of cheaper ones. |
| Steve     | 00:22 | And it has to stop.                                          |
| Steve     | 00:24 | Wasting money is dumb.                                       |
| Steve     | 00:27 | Saving money is smart.                                       |
| Steve     | 00:29 | It really is as simple as that.                              |
| Steve     | 00:31 | Well, I'm done.                                              |
| Steve     | 00:32 | Over to you, Max.                                            |
| Max       | 00:34 | Hello everybody.                                             |
| Max       | 00:35 | Thanks for coming.                                           |
| Max       | 00:36 | Okay, I've spent the last few weeks studying some of our ordering procedures here, and there are a lot of problems. |
| Max       | 00:44 | People are ordering things without checking if we have them already or how many of them we need. |
| Max       | 00:50 | Take highlighting pens, for example.                         |
| Max       | 00:53 | We have 45 blue pens, 17 orange pens and three yellow pens.  |
| Max       | 01:01 | So why is this?                                              |
| Max       | 01:03 | Because people are ordering sets of pens instead of individual pens. |
| Max       | 01:09 | But they're only using the yellow and some of the orange ones. |
| Max       | 01:14 | No one uses the blue pens at all.                            |
| Max       | 01:17 | We order Those pens at seven fifty a set from Office Guy.    |
| Max       | 01:22 | But we could get them for one twenty-five each from office Discount. |
| Max       | 01:26 | So I want everyone to find five examples of waste in their department and show how they're going to stop this waste in the future. |
| Max       | 01:34 | You have till Friday next week to send me your reports.      |
| Luara     | 01:38 | That's going to be really difficult for me, Max.             |
| Luara     | 01:42 | I don't think there's any waste in my department.            |
| Max       | 01:45 | I don't agree.                                               |
| Max       | 01:46 | I found 17 examples of waste in your department, wasting money or time or materials. |
| Luara     | 01:53 | Are you sure?                                                |
| Luara     | 01:54 | Can you give me some examples?                               |
| Steve     | 01:57 | Thanks, Laura, but I think we probably don't need to go into that level of detail right now. |
| Steve     | 02:01 | Before we go, I want to add one other really important point. |
| Steve     | 02:04 | We're not getting the best prices from our suppliers.        |
| Steve     | 02:07 | We're not pressing them hard enough.                         |
| Steve     | 02:09 | That's another way.                                          |
| Steve     | 02:10 | We're wasting money.                                         |
| Steve     | 02:11 | Okay, team, go to it.                                        |
| Steve     | 02:13 | All of you, let's start getting some great prices and let's really stop that waste. |
| Dominic   | 02:19 | I don't believe what I just heard.                           |
| Alice     | 02:22 | Yeah, well, a dollar Saved is a dollar earned, etc, etc.     |
| Alice     | 02:26 | Anyway, how do we share the work?                            |
| Alice     | 02:29 | If you like, I'll talk to the suppliers and you can look at our procedures. |
| Dominic   | 02:33 | I really don't know which of the two is less interesting.    |
| Alice     | 02:38 | So I was wondering, can't you do better than that?           |
| Assistant | 02:42 | I've already taken off 5%.                                   |
| Alice     | 02:45 | That's what I'm saying.                                      |
| Alice     | 02:46 | 5% isn't enough.                                             |
| Assistant | 02:48 | But the 5% off is only if you order more than 500 folders and you only want 200 so I'm already giving you a great deal. |
| Assistant | 02:57 | Come on, Alice, you aren't usually like this.                |
| Assistant | 03:01 | What's got into you today?                                   |
| Assistant | 03:03 | Boyfriend troubles?                                          |
| Alice     | 03:04 | No, it's just, you know, we have to find ways of saving money. |
| Assistant | 03:09 | Tell me about it.                                            |
| Assistant | 03:10 | That's all I hear from my boss too.                          |
| Assistant | 03:13 | Save money, Save money. Save money.                          |
| Assistant | 03:16 | I'm thinking.                                                |
| Assistant | 03:17 | So how about your sales conference in Hawaii then?           |
| Assistant | 03:21 | But I want to keep my job so I don't say it.                 |
| Alice     | 03:24 | Anyway, back to these folders.                               |
| Alice     | 03:27 | We've always bought them from you, but we are looking at other suppliers, like office discount. |
| Assistant | 03:32 | Yeah, everybody talks about office discount.                 |
| Assistant | 03:35 | Okay, they're cheaper than us.                               |
| Assistant | 03:37 | A bit cheaper, but we offer better value for the money.      |
| Alice     | 03:41 | What do you mean by better value for the money?              |
| Assistant | 03:43 | We deliver in two days, they deliver in a week.              |
| Alice     | 03:47 | Okay, but we don't care.                                     |
| Alice     | 03:49 | A week is no problem.                                        |
| Alice     | 03:50 | What else?                                                   |
| Assistant | 03:52 | Our folders are better quality than theirs.                  |
| Assistant | 03:54 | We offer more colors.                                        |
| Alice     | 03:56 | I can't see any difference in quality.                       |
| Alice     | 03:58 | And we don't need the extra colors.                          |
| Alice     | 04:00 | Blue is fine.                                                |
| Assistant | 04:01 | Okay. Okay, you win.                                         |
| Assistant | 04:03 | I'll give you 10% off the list price.                        |
| Assistant | 04:06 | Will that do?                                                |
| Supplier  | 04:09 | Wait a moment.                                               |
| Supplier  | 04:10 | Sunil, we agreed on the price for those computers.           |
| Supplier  | 04:13 | We said 900 for the laptops and 500 for the desktops.        |
| Sunil     | 04:17 | Did we?                                                      |
| Sunil     | 04:18 | Was that in an email?                                        |
| Sunil     | 04:20 | Yes, I can't find it.                                        |
| Sunil     | 04:22 | Can you remember the date?                                   |
| Supplier  | 04:24 | It was April 20th.                                           |
| Supplier  | 04:26 | You replied the day after saying accepted.                   |
| Sunil     | 04:28 | Sunil, hold on, I'm just looking for it.                     |
| Sunil     | 04:32 | Oh yes, found it.                                            |
| Supplier  | 04:34 | So you accepted the price in writing.                        |
| Supplier  | 04:36 | That means you can't change it now.                          |
| Sunil     | 04:38 | Well, it wasn't exactly in writing.                          |
| Sunil     | 04:40 | It was just an email.                                        |
| Supplier  | 04:42 | What are you trying to say?                                  |
| Sunil     | 04:44 | I'm just saying an email isn't a contract, that's all.       |
| Supplier  | 04:49 | Yeah, I know that.                                           |
| Supplier  | 04:50 | I also know that I just ordered 250 computers after I got your email. |
| Sunil     | 04:55 | Right.                                                       |
| Sunil     | 04:56 | Okay, that's a problem.                                      |
| Sunil     | 04:59 | You see, my CEO isn't happy with these prices.               |
| Supplier  | 05:04 | So?                                                          |
| Sunil     | 05:05 | So he told me to look at some other suppliers or.            |
| Supplier  | 05:08 | What are you trying to do here?                              |
| Supplier  | 05:09 | Kill me?                                                     |
| Sunil     | 05:10 | Or get you to reduce your prices?                            |
| Supplier  | 05:13 | Ah, the hell with it.                                        |
| Supplier  | 05:14 | I'll take 30 off the laptops and 20 off the desktops.        |
| Supplier  | 05:18 | Don't ask me for anything more.                              |
| Supplier  | 05:19 | That's the best I can do.                                    |
| Steve     | 05:26 | Thanks for coming everybody.                                 |
| Steve     | 05:28 | Look, I wasn't going to make this into a competition, but then I thought, well, why not? |
| Steve     | 05:33 | Let's have a bit of fun.                                     |
| Steve     | 05:36 | So who's the winner of the Barico Save Money and Stop Waste competition? |
| Steve     | 05:41 | I won't keep you waiting any longer.                         |
| Steve     | 05:42 | It's sunil he saved $6,250 on the new computer order.        |
| Steve     | 05:48 | Come here, Sunil.                                            |
| Steve     | 05:50 | Well done.                                                   |
| Steve     | 05:51 | And you know how he did it?                                  |
| Steve     | 05:53 | Just by going back to the supplier and pressing him on the price. |
| Steve     | 05:57 | That's the way.                                              |
| Steve     | 05:58 | So keep pressing, team.                                      |
| Steve     | 05:59 | And let's keep those prices down.                            |
| Steve     | 06:02 | That's all for now.                                          |
