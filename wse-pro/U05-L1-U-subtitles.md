| Cameron  | 00:00 | There's one other thing I'd like you to take care of while I'm away. |
| Cameron  | 00:02 | I need you to deal with all incoming phone calls for me.     |
| Cameron  | 00:05 | Either take messages or pass them on to me directly.         |
| Alice    | 00:07 | Of course, no problem.                                       |
| Cameron  | 00:10 | One other point.                                             |
| Cameron  | 00:10 | If possible, take care of things yourself.                   |
| Cameron  | 00:13 | Don't involve me if it isn't absolutely necessary.           |
| Cameron  | 00:16 | Bye for now.                                                 |
| Alice    | 00:19 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Alice    | 00:20 | What did you say the name of your company was?               |
| Connolly | 00:22 | Connolly International Marketing.                            |
| Connolly | 00:24 | I'm surprised you haven't heard of me.                       |
| Connolly | 00:27 | I'm the President and CEO.                                   |
| Alice    | 00:29 | I'm sorry, Mr. Connolly, but Cameron didn't leave any instructions regarding you or your company. |
| Connolly | 00:34 | Well, of course not.                                         |
| Connolly | 00:36 | I'm calling about a very important matter.                   |
| Connolly | 00:39 | I expect her to deal with me personally.                     |
| Alice    | 00:42 | Okay.                                                        |
| Alice    | 00:43 | May I ask what you are calling about, Mr. Connolly?          |
| Connolly | 00:46 | Oh, very well.                                               |
| Connolly | 00:48 | It's about our marketing plan for your company.              |
| Alice    | 00:51 | Your marketing plan?                                         |
| Alice    | 00:53 | Uh, is this something that Cameron asked you to prepare?     |
| Connolly | 00:57 | Not as such, no.                                             |
| Connolly | 00:58 | I. I prepared it as a sample of my firm's work.              |
| Alice    | 01:02 | Okay, great.                                                 |
| Alice    | 01:03 | Look, I'll ask Cameron to call you as soon as she has a moment. |
| Alice    | 01:12 | I'm sorry.                                                   |
| Alice    | 01:12 | I'm afraid Cameron's away at the moment.                     |
| Marina   | 01:15 | My dear girl, I know she's away.                             |
| Marina   | 01:16 | She told me herself.                                         |
| Alice    | 01:18 | I'm sorry.                                                   |
| Alice    | 01:18 | Is that Marina Rinaldi?                                      |
| Alice    | 01:20 | I didn't recognize you at first.                             |
| Marina   | 01:22 | That's quite all right.                                      |
| Marina   | 01:23 | I just need to know when she expects to finish her meetings tomorrow evening. |
| Alice    | 01:26 | Well, she should be through by 7:30, but the thing is, she's in Tokyo, which is 13 hours ahead of you, so. |
| Marina   | 01:35 | Yes, she told me.                                            |
| Marina   | 01:36 | I'm in Shanghai myself and there's only one hour's time difference. |
| Alice    | 01:40 | Sorry again.                                                 |
| Alice    | 01:41 | I assumed you were in New York.                              |
| Marina   | 01:43 | Some advice for you, my dear.                                |
| Marina   | 01:45 | Never assume anything.                                       |
| Marina   | 01:47 | Thank you anyway.                                            |
| Marina   | 01:48 | Bye.                                                         |
| Alice    | 01:53 | Are you sure that a meeting is really necessary?             |
| Alice    | 01:56 | Perhaps if you just email your report to Cameron and she can come back to you with questions if she has any. |
| Mantro   | 02:02 | I spent six months on this report and it contains a lot of highly technical information. |
| Mantro   | 02:08 | It's essential that I present it to her in person.           |
| Alice    | 02:12 | Excuse me a moment.                                          |
| Alice    | 02:13 | There's someone on the other line.                           |
| Alice    | 02:15 | Hello?                                                       |
| Alice    | 02:15 | Cameron Diallo's office.                                     |
| Santa    | 02:17 | Your car is ready.                                           |
| Alice    | 02:18 | Sorry.                                                       |
| Santa    | 02:19 | Your car is ready to be picked up now.                       |
| Santa    | 02:21 | We're open till 7pm can we expect you today?                 |
| Mantro   | 02:25 | Are you still there?                                         |
| Alice    | 02:26 | Yes.                                                         |
| Alice    | 02:26 | Can you hold just a moment, please, Mr. Mantro?              |
| Alice    | 02:30 | Excuse me.                                                   |
| Alice    | 02:30 | Who is this, please?                                         |
| Santa    | 02:32 | This is the Santa Monica BMW dealership.                     |
| Santa    | 02:35 | Is this Ms. Diallo?                                          |
| Alice    | 02:36 | Oh, I see.                                                   |
| Alice    | 02:38 | No, I'm her assistant, Alice Pettit.                         |
| Alice    | 02:40 | Ms. Diallo is away on business.                              |
| Santa    | 02:42 | Oh, really?                                                  |
| Santa    | 02:43 | She Said she wanted the car back as soon as possible.        |
| Santa    | 02:47 | So when can we expect her to come and pick it up?            |
| Mantro   | 02:49 | May I ask how much longer you're planning to keep me waiting? |
| Alice    | 02:53 | One more moment, please, Mr. Mantro.                         |
| Alice    | 02:55 | I'm really not sure, but I'll definitely pass on your message. |
| Santa    | 02:59 | Can you also tell her that we charge $50 a day parking fee after the first 24 hours? |
| Alice    | 03:04 | Oh, I see.                                                   |
| Alice    | 03:05 | No problem.                                                  |
| Alice    | 03:06 | I mean, sure.                                                |
| Alice    | 03:08 | Look, we'll send someone over to pick up the car.            |
| Alice    | 03:12 | Thank you very much.                                         |
| Santa    | 03:13 | My pleasure.                                                 |
| Alice    | 03:15 | I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Mantro.                |
| Mantro   | 03:18 | At last.                                                     |
| Alice    | 03:19 | So you wanted to set up a meeting with Cameron.              |
| Alice    | 03:22 | Why don't I pencil you in for the week after next?           |
| Alice    | 03:25 | How about Tuesday the 17th at 2pm?                           |
| Mantro   | 03:28 | Exactly, do you mean by pencil me in?                        |
| Mantro   | 03:30 | I hate all this jargon.                                      |
| Alice    | 03:32 | Well, I don't know if Cameron set up another meeting for that time because she's away. |
| Alice    | 03:36 | So I don't have access to her diary.                         |
| Mantro   | 03:38 | I see.                                                       |
| Mantro   | 03:39 | It all sounds extremely disorganized.                        |
| Mantro   | 03:42 | Well, please let me know well in advance if anything changes. |
| Mantro   | 03:46 | Good afternoon.                                              |
| Alice    | 03:47 | Goodbye. Mr. Mantro.                                         |
| Alice    | 03:49 | I need a coffee.                                             |
| Alice    | 03:53 | Oh no.                                                       |
| Alice    | 03:55 | Hello, this is ...                                           |
| Mom      | 03:57 | Alice, I hope you don't mind me calling you at work.         |
| Alice    | 04:00 | Oh, mom, look, this really isn't a great time to talk.       |
| Alice    | 04:04 | Oh no.                                                       |
| Alice    | 04:05 | Someone's calling on the other line now.                     |
| Alice    | 04:07 | Sorry, would you mind holding for a moment please?           |
| Alice    | 04:10 | Look, mom, why don't you call me at home this evening?       |
| Alice    | 04:14 | I don't believe it.                                          |
| Alice    | 04:15 | Now someone's calling me on my cell.                         |
| Cameron  | 04:18 | Alice, why didn't you take my call?                          |
| Alice    | 04:20 | Well, the thing is, I was.                                   |
| Cameron  | 04:22 | Why did you tell me to hold without first asking who I was?  |
| Alice    | 04:25 | I'm sorry, I was on the other line.                          |
| Cameron  | 04:27 | So who were you talking to that was so important?            |
| Alice    | 04:29 | Oh, it was just.                                             |
| Cameron  | 04:30 | Oh, never mind.                                              |
| Cameron  | 04:31 | It's four in the morning here and I need to sleep.           |
| Cameron  | 04:34 | A couple of points I forgot to mention.                      |
| Cameron  | 04:36 | I need you to call Marina Ronaldi and tell her I'll be free tomorrow around 7:30pm my time. |
| Alice    | 04:42 | I've already told her.                                       |
| Cameron  | 04:43 | Really?                                                      |
| Cameron  | 04:44 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron  | 04:45 | The other thing is my car.                                   |
| Cameron  | 04:47 | It should be ready tomorrow.                                 |
| Cameron  | 04:49 | Get Rick to go and pick it up.                               |
| Alice    | 04:50 | I've taken care of that too.                                 |
| Cameron  | 04:52 | Very good.                                                   |
| Cameron  | 04:53 | Well done, Alice.                                            |
| Cameron  | 04:54 | Okay.                                                        |
| Cameron  | 04:55 | There's nothing for me to do but go to bed then.             |
| Cameron  | 04:57 | Good night.                                                  |
| Alice    | 04:58 | Good night.                                                  |
| Alice    | 04:59 | Sleep well.                                                  |
| Alice    | 05:01 | Sorry, Mom.                                                  |
| Alice    | 05:02 | That was my boss calling from Tokyo.                         |
| Mom      | 05:04 | We all have our priorities, don't we?                        |
| Mom      | 05:07 | So we can have a chat this evening then?                     |
| Alice    | 05:09 | Definitely.                                                  |
| Mom      | 05:11 | You never seem to have time to talk these days.              |
