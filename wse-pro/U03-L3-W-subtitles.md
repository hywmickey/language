| Alice   | 00:04 | Excuse me, Dominic, have you got a moment?                   |
| Dominic | 00:08 | For you, Alice, I have all the moments in the world.         |
| Dominic | 00:11 | What's the problem?                                          |
| Alice   | 00:12 | It's this employee evaluation form.                          |
| Alice   | 00:15 | I just got it in my email this morning.                      |
| Alice   | 00:17 | I just don't know how to fill it out.                        |
| Alice   | 00:20 | That's the problem.                                          |
| Alice   | 00:22 | Does the employee seem to enjoy his or her work?             |
| Alice   | 00:25 | Do you choose 1, 2 or 3?                                     |
| Alice   | 00:27 | How can I answer that question?                              |
| Alice   | 00:30 | You see what I mean?                                         |
| Dominic | 00:31 | Oh, you look like you just love your job, Alice.             |
| Dominic | 00:35 | Give yourself three out of three.                            |
| Dominic | 00:37 | No, four out of three.                                       |
| Alice   | 00:40 | No, my point is, how do you evaluate yourself?               |
| Alice   | 00:44 | I mean, do you try to say only good stuff or do you look for problems or what? |
| Dominic | 00:51 | You can look at mine if it helps.                            |
| Dominic | 00:53 | I'm just doing it now.                                       |
| Dominic | 00:56 | Barico Inc.                                                  |
| Dominic | 00:57 | Employee Performance Evaluation.                             |
| Dominic | 01:00 | Blah blah blah.                                              |
| Dominic | 01:02 | Ok, here we are.                                             |
| Dominic | 01:04 | Does the employee finish his or her work within specifications and on time? |
| Dominic | 01:09 | I'd put three for that.                                      |
| Dominic | 01:11 | Next question.                                               |
| Dominic | 01:13 | Is the employee willing and able to work with others?        |
| Dominic | 01:17 | That's something I know I'm especially good at.              |
| Dominic | 01:19 | So three again.                                              |
| Alice   | 01:21 | So you just put three for everything then?                   |
| Dominic | 01:24 | No, of course not.                                           |
| Dominic | 01:26 | The things you're really good at, you put three.             |
| Dominic | 01:29 | But for example, does the employee always follow instructions? |
| Dominic | 01:36 | I only put two for that because, you know, I'm totally not a yes man. |
| Dominic | 01:41 | Anyway, you get the picture.                                 |
| Dominic | 01:42 | Okay, I have to go back to this now.                         |
| Alice   | 01:45 | Sure.                                                        |
| Alice   | 01:46 | Thanks a lot, Dominic.                                       |
| Dominic | 01:55 | Hi there.                                                    |
| Dominic | 01:56 | Dominic Payne, head of Mar.                                  |
| Dominic | 01:59 | Sure, Cameron, I'll be right there.                          |
| Dominic | 02:02 | My great moment.                                             |
| Dominic | 02:04 | See you later.                                               |
| Cameron | 02:14 | Come in, Dominic.                                            |
| Cameron | 02:15 | Take a seat.                                                 |
| Cameron | 02:17 | I've been looking at your self evaluation and I've made some changes. |
| Cameron | 02:21 | A lot of changes.                                            |
| Dominic | 02:22 | No problems, I hope.                                         |
| Cameron | 02:24 | Before we go into the details, I just want to make a few general comments. |
| Cameron | 02:30 | You know what the idea of these forms is, don't you?         |
| Dominic | 02:33 | Well, yes.                                                   |
| Dominic | 02:34 | It's to help you evaluate us, our performance, how we do our jobs. |
| Cameron | 02:41 | Yes and no.                                                  |
| Cameron | 02:42 | The main idea is for you to think about your work and your performance and to see where you could do better. |
| Dominic | 02:48 | Oh yes, of course.                                           |
| Dominic | 02:50 | That's what I did, didn't I?                                 |
| Cameron | 02:52 | I didn't see much I could do better, but I saw a lot of.     |
| Cameron | 02:57 | I already do this extremely well.                            |
| Dominic | 03:00 | You know, if you're good at something, why not say so?       |
| Dominic | 03:03 | No one else is going to, right?                              |
| Cameron | 03:07 | Okay, let's look at the details if you're ready.             |
| Cameron | 03:10 | Take this item.                                              |
| Cameron | 03:11 | Is the employee willing and able to work with others?        |
| Cameron | 03:15 | You put a three for that?                                    |
| Dominic | 03:16 | Yeah.                                                        |
| Dominic | 03:17 | I mean, I get along pretty well with my co workers, don't I? |
| Cameron | 03:21 | No, I don't think you do.                                    |
| Cameron | 03:23 | Anyway, it's not just about getting along with people.       |
| Cameron | 03:25 | It's about really working together.                          |
| Cameron | 03:28 | And that's not something you're very good at, is it?         |
| Dominic | 03:31 | Well, ok, maybe that's not really a three either.            |
| Dominic | 03:35 | But I didn't put three everywhere.                           |
| Cameron | 03:37 | What?                                                        |
| Cameron | 03:38 | You mean this one?                                           |
| Cameron | 03:39 | Does the employee always follow instructions?                |
| Dominic | 03:42 | That's right.                                                |
| Dominic | 03:42 | I only put a two there.                                      |
| Cameron | 03:44 | What was your reason?                                        |
| Dominic | 03:45 | Well, I'm not a yes man, you know.                           |
| Dominic | 03:48 | I have my own ideas.                                         |
| Cameron | 03:50 | I don't know about that, Dominic.                            |
| Cameron | 03:51 | Actually, I think you are something of a yes man.            |
| Cameron | 03:54 | Your own ideas?                                              |
| Cameron | 03:57 | Maybe.                                                       |
| Cameron | 03:58 | Look, I don't think I need to say much more, but do you want to keep working for BarryCo? |
| Dominic | 04:03 | Yes, of course.                                              |
| Cameron | 04:05 | Well then you've got some things to look at.                 |
| Cameron | 04:07 | I want to see you working better with your co workers.       |
| Cameron | 04:10 | Especially Alice.                                            |
| Cameron | 04:11 | And when people ask you to do things, listen to what they're saying. |
| Cameron | 04:16 | Okay.                                                        |
| Dominic | 04:17 | Okay, I'm sorry.                                             |
| Cameron | 04:19 | Okay, that's all then.                                       |
| Cameron | 04:21 | I'll put all this in writing and email it to you.            |
| Dominic | 04:25 | Thanks.                                                      |
| Dominic | 04:25 | I'll try to do better.                                       |
| Cameron | 04:27 | Good.                                                        |
| Alice   | 04:36 | What happened?                                               |
| Dominic | 04:37 | I don't want to talk about.                                  |
| Dominic | 04:39 | Oh, she had some things to say.                              |
| Alice   | 04:42 | What kind of things?                                         |
| Dominic | 04:44 | She's just impossible.                                       |
| Dominic | 04:46 | She expects you to be a hundred percent perfect all the time. |
| Dominic | 04:50 | No.                                                          |
| Dominic | 04:51 | 110%.                                                        |
| Dominic | 04:53 | 120%.                                                        |
| Dominic | 04:56 | Well, I'm sorry.                                             |
| Dominic | 04:57 | I'm a person, not some kind of machine.                      |
| Alice   | 05:09 | Is it okay now?                                              |
| Cameron | 05:11 | Yeah, sure.                                                  |
| Cameron | 05:12 | Have a seat.                                                 |
| Cameron | 05:13 | You don't have to look so nervous.                           |
| Cameron | 05:17 | Alice, do you know what these numbers mean?                  |
| Alice   | 05:19 | I think so.                                                  |
| Alice   | 05:21 | I thought so.                                                |
| Cameron | 05:22 | One means that there's really a serious problem.             |
| Cameron | 05:26 | Two is okay, but no more than that.                          |
| Cameron | 05:29 | And three means that you do something well.                  |
| Cameron | 05:32 | So a good employee is going to get a lot of twos with a few threes and no ones at all. |
| Alice   | 05:39 | Sorry, were my numbers way too high then?                    |
| Cameron | 05:42 | No, Alice, they were too low.                                |
| Cameron | 05:44 | You only put twos and ones?                                  |
| Cameron | 05:46 | No threes at all?                                            |
| Alice   | 05:48 | Oh, well, it's not easy to evaluate yourself, you know.      |
| Alice   | 05:52 | I didn't want to say like, oh, I'm totally great at this.    |
| Alice   | 05:56 | When maybe you don't think so.                               |
| Alice   | 05:59 | So I thought, you know, it's better to be safe.              |
| Cameron | 06:02 | It is possible to be too safe.                               |
| Cameron | 06:05 | Like this one, for example.                                  |
| Cameron | 06:07 | Is the employee able to use information to make good decisions? |
| Cameron | 06:11 | You've put two, but for me you're three.                     |
| Cameron | 06:15 | I feel I can trust you to make the right decisions.          |
| Alice   | 06:18 | Oh, thank you.                                               |
| Cameron | 06:20 | Or this one.                                                 |
| Cameron | 06:21 | Does the employee always follow instructions?                |
| Cameron | 06:24 | You put two, but I give you a three for sure.                |
| Alice   | 06:28 | I just thought, you know, that time.                         |
| Cameron | 06:31 | With those emails already forgotten.                         |
| Cameron | 06:34 | Relax, Alice.                                                |
| Cameron | 06:35 | I don't expect you to be 100% perfect 100% of the time.      |
| Cameron | 06:41 | 95% at the time is good enough for me.                       |
| Alice   | 06:45 | I'll try for 96 or 97.                                       |
